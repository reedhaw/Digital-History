   ID18,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,9,21,persuade,A short DESCRIPTION of and REMARKS upon a new State called THE WESTERN TERRITORY being one of four settled by the Americans since 1774. T HAT no nation can serve the Americans with goods equal in quality and price to Britain is wha the whole world knows and from experience the most obstinate rebel American dare not deny: It is with pleasure therefore we inform our readers that the United States are paying more attention to agriculture than to manufactures–They have already laid out four new States since the beginning of their rebellion viz. Vermont Kentucky Indiana and The Western Territory. About seventeen years ago Vermont was a wilderness; they only began to settle it about the year 1774. Kentucky ten years ago lay in forest wild; it was settled in 1780. Yet so rapid has been the population that there are not less than one hundred thousand inhabitants already in each of these states. The State of Indiana was only laid off this present year in 1789 and contains but two or three hundred inhabitants. From a description of these four States published in America in May last we give our readers a short abridged description of the last of them called The Western Territory ; and it must rerejoice the heart of every Briton to read it and think that the settling of these countries though the Americans double their numbers every 15 or 20 years will long keep them from manufacturing and is every day opening a field for new customers to Great Britain; for who will work as a tradesman even though wages are very high when he can for twenty pounds purchase a thousand acres of land that being the present price fixed by Congress for lots of land in The Western Territory.–Hence the demand of our manufactures will continually increase with the increasing population of America.–Desponding politicians may derive comfort from the prospect that new channels of commerce will be opened and the inland parts of the Continent will require an increasing supply.–British manufactures will for ages ascend the great rivers of that Continent and by means of a most extraordinary inland navigation will be diffused through a country more fertile more extensive than all the Thirteen United States. The Western Territory Is the name given to this new State by Congress. It is bounded on the west by the Mississippi river –north by the Lakes–east by Pennsylvania? south and south-east by the Ohio river; contains according to Mr. Hutchins Geographer General to the Congress 411000 square miles equal to two hundred and sixty-three millions of acres from which he deducts forth-three millions of acres for water; there will then remain two hundred and twenty millions of acres belonging to the fed–ral government which is to be sold for the discharge of the debt owing to the United States. But a very small proportion of these lands is yet purchased of the native Indians and disposed of by Congress*. On the lands which have been purchased by Congress from the Indians two settlements are already commenced–one at Marietta the other at Miami. This State was only laid out by Congress in the end of the year 1787 and already contains above 8000 inhabitants. The principal rivers are the Mississippi Ohio Muskingham Hockhocking Sioto Miami Wobash&c–Coal and iron mines and salt pits abound in this State; the soil is excellent?as rich as can be imagined and may be reduced to yield plentiful crops with little or no labour. It is exceedingly healthy pleasant and commodious–the most fertile spot of earth known to the Europeans or Americans–exceeding the soil of any of the United States. The timber is tall and in great variety?Streams for mills abound here. Wheat indigo hemp and cotton thrive well. Many years will probably not escape before a good part of the country will be brought to that degree of cultivation that will exhibit all its latent beauties and fulfill the description of travellers who call it the garden of the world. It is here probably also that the center of a great empire will be fixed in some future period. It is the most centrical place for Congress to accommodate themselves at. No country is better stocked with wild game of every kind; herds of deers elks bears &c fill the extensive meadows of thie country?turkies geese swans and partridges &c. are innumerable. The rivers are excellently stored with fish and almost all navigable for small sloops. In the ordinance published by Congress for the government of this territory they are to be allowed an Assembly when their number amounts to 30000 persons; and when they acquire a certain degree of population they are to have representatives in Congress; and when fifty millions of acres are settled they are to be divided into States. Rejoice O Britons! that they must all be supplied with manufactures by you and you only! * No more than about twelve millions of acres have yet been purchased of the poor natives for which Congress gave them only eight thousand dollars value in goods and rum. ,Native Americans;trade;agriculture;settlement description
   ID31,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,11,27,persuade,What mighty contests rise from trivial things; That the present Revolution in France is a consequence of the Revolution in America cannot admit of a doubt. The American Revolution originated in Adams a very insignificant Bostonian. Not that this Adams had the least expectation of American independence when he fomented the opposition to the stamp-act; indeed no human wisdom could possibly have foreseen the subsequent folly and imprudence of the British administration and its obsequious Parliament. An Administration so totally destitute of common sense so totally ignorant of every princple of sound policy no nation ever beheld. Adams had the sagacity to avail himself of such despicable policies.–Fortunately for the American cause the Generals that were sent from England were of congenial abilities with the Minister and the Americans themselves were surprised at the facility with which they acquired their independence. –Yet all the blunders of the British administration and the miserable conduct of the British Generals would hardly have been sufficient to emancipate America notwithstanding her extreme weakeness without the assistance of France; and this assistance depended entirely on Dr. Franklin being driven to Paris by the fatal-philippic of a certain great lawyer. Such therefore is the chain of concurrent circumstances that hath overturned the French monarch. If the British minister had possessed common sagacity–if he could have distinguished a general from a corporal; if Franklin had been treated with common civility America would have remained a British colony and France an absolute monarch for ages yet to come. ,revolution
   ID48,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,12,18,persuade,The Minister is now said to be employed in drawing up two plans which will give rise to very warm debates in Parliament : one is for settling a commercial arrangement between Great Britain and Ireland ; the other for giving a constitution to Canada. In feeling the former the Minister will have to contend with strong commercial prejudices; in the latter he will have to encounter religious principles. The British settlers in Canada are comparatively few in number. The great bulk of the Canadians are the descendants of French and are Roman Catholics. The former are Protestants. Fleaury in france and Walpole in England were not fonder of peace than Mr. Pitt. Conquests may be made by war but consequence and wealth can only be obtained by a pacific system if the first commercial nation in the world. Besides these considerations the grand secret has been discovered since the present Minister came into power that the best riddance England ever had was of her American Colonies ; because by this means she becomes thoroughly collected at home to oppose every foreign power without the expence and blood of supporting the Americans at the same time that they cannot do without BRitish manufactures in one line or another. Thus they are under the necessity of protecting themselves at the same time that like the rest of Europe they are obliged to resort to our superior mercantile market. Application has been lately made to the Lords of the Treasury for an order on the Bank to issue some of the new silver coin in aid of the present want of silver for circulation the scarcity of which is much felt by retail traders in particular. ,trade;Anglo-American relations;religion

When in the above climate the winters have been severe they have invariably been mild with us and vice versa. Now the ships which sailed from Newfoundland the beginning of October last saw the hills already covered with snow. There is still another argument in favour of a mild winter with us. Previously to the setting in of a severe one nature in her bounty has been always observed to have provided an uncommon store of wild briar fruits as a nourishment to the smaller birds who would otherwise perish a vast carpet of snow spreading itself over the ground so as to prevent their coming at the worms &c. on which they are accustomed to feed.

   ID130,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1818,12,28,persuade,Emigration to America Our paper of Thursday last contained a general view of some of the most popular publications on the subject of emigration and we shall now endeavour briefly to make an estimate of the good and evil which is likely to befall those who embark in this hazardous adventure. There is one important fact which we gather from all the accounts of America whether written for the purpose of praise or censure namely that there is a great demand for labour and that wages are high and this effect is necessarily produced y the vast space of fertile and unoccupied territory which lies westward of the United States towards the Pacific Ocean. It is this vacant territory which is the true spring of this American community. Here is the grand outlet for the superflouous population both of the eastern states of America and of Europe. To cultivate this waste there is a constant demand for new labourers ; wages are of course high – the labourer lives in comfort and if he is industrious he becomes in his turn a purchaser of land from the savings which he accumulates. If labour should become more plentiful and wages should fall this is the signal for new emigrations ; and thus this constant demand for labour in the western districts regulates its general price throughout the United States. In these circumstrances it is clear that a labourer provided he can reach this advantageous market for his labour will unquestionably improve his condition. But herein lies the difficulty. A labourer has seldom the means of of subsistence so far beforehand as to enable him to undertake so long a journey ; and if he enters upon the enterprise with insufficient means he is liable to starve before he can transport himself to his ultimate destination or he is forced to contract for immediate subsistence obligations little short of servitude under the weight of which he is grievously oppressed. These then form strong objections to emigrations in the case of those who are stinted to their means ; but where these objections can be surmounted those who can transport their labour from the overstocked market of Europe to the understocked market of America will unquestionably dispose of it to better advantage ; but if they have not the means they may as furely fail in the attempt and draw upon themselves aggravated misery and want. As to the consequences of emigration to this country we hold them rather to be beneficial than otherwise and we cannot easily account for the very absurd alarm which has been propagated on this subject. The evil in Europe is that every country is overcrowded with labourers who cannot find employment ; and is it not manifest therefore that the withdrawing of some of these will make more room for the labourers that remain – that the loss of those useless hands will rather be a relief to the body politic and will diffuse greater soundness and vigour through all its parts? That these effects will follow from emigration in this or in any other country in Europe we cannot doubt – and that the labourer if he can afford the expence of the journey will receive higher wages in America than in this country is equally clear. There is another class of adventurers who may possibly improve their circumstances by emigration although this is not so certain namely farmers with a moderate capital. An allotment of land may be purchased in the back parts of America at the Government price of two dollars per acre and an emigrant who can afford to but and to cultivate 100 or 200 acres and acts with proper judgement and skill may undoubtedly by a speculation of this sort be sure of a subsistence while by the continued emigrations from the eastern states the country being quickly settled all around him his property is daily improving in value. But a want of judgement in the purchase or a want of ability to cultivate the land after it is purchased may involve him in irrecoverable distress and ruin ; and to avoid these hazards no little discrimination and prudence is necessary. Such are some of the most striking advantages of emigration and we shall now state some of its disadvantages. The first and chief of these is the difficulty of effecting a settlement and of subsisting until the land which is purchased yields its first produce. The country is partly open ground or prairie as it is called or it is covered with almost boundless forests. A settlement in the woods requires incredible labour to clear it – labour is dear and not easily procured and this herculean task naturally devolves on the head of the family who is forced during the day to ply the axe in this laborious drudgery of felling trees and afterwards to follow the chace for a meal to his family. Here he must frequently sleep out in the woods ; and his body exhausted with his day's labour is exposed to the cold dews of night ; under such unintermitted toil his health declines and it is obvious that his family deprived even for a single day of his exertions must be reduced to the most deplorable straits. In many parts the country which is marked out for emigrants is extremely unhealthy in particular the banks of all the navigable rivers which afford the most eligible settlements both in point of fertility and situation are exposed to the most fatal maladies. The same causes which produce fertility produce disease. The overflowing of the waters from the autumnal and spring floods fertilise the land in a most wonderful degree ; but the exhalations of these stagnant waters under a burning sun are as fatal to the health as the deposits which they leave are favourable to the soil. Hence the many minute directions which are given to all emigrants in regard to their health. In a letter contained in the Emigrant's Guide we have the following advice to those who are descending the Ohio : If the weather becomes warm guard well against the smell of bilge water. But if you must descend in the spring go early – avoid all delay and remember you are fleeing for your lives. I have seen the havoc and I believed it not till then. Again it is observed Let nothing tempt you to fish in warm weather immediately on changing your climate. The effluvia of the shores is poison. To a European emigran the climate must be of course even more fatal ; and he either therefore lose his health or he must be continually tormented with anxiously taking care of it which makes it a question whether it is worth having on such terms. Such are the hardships through which if he has strength to endure them he at length emerges into ease and independence. These hardships however will no doubt be in a great measure avoided or at least mitigated if he has beforehand provided the means of subsistence until he can derive regular supplies from his own land. In this case he is less liable to be dislodged from his situation by the casualties to which all emigrants are necessarily exposed. – He is secured against the hardships of a first settlement and is more certain of attaining the wished for object of ease and affluence – To a farmer therefore or a labourer emigration presents a fair chance of a permanent settlement provided it is gone about with ordinary caution and the necessary degree of energy be exerted to insure success. But it is a gross delusion to imagine that an elysium is to be found in the United States or that mankind exist there on any more favourable terms than in this country and those who set out on any such visionary schemes are sure to meet with a woeful disappointment. With regard to other classes of society it does not appear that they will improve their condition by emigration to America ; there is no demand for clerks or professional men of any sort and no merchant has any thing to expect by removing his capital to the United States. In the back settlements there is a demand for schoolmasters to teach the ordinary branches of education and several emigrants of this class have met with good encouragement. In regard to the essential article of comfort it is apparent from all the best information on the subject that a person long resident in this country would change for the worse by an emigration to the United States. He would in the first place suffer extremely from the climate from the extreme cold of winter and the raging heat of summer the thermometer frequently standing at 98 degrees in the share with a clear sky and broiling sun and very little abatement of this exsessive heat being experienced through the night. His frame accustomed to the more temperate though unsettled climate of this country runs the risk of being debilitated by the change and at all events he must suffer extremely in his enjoyments and in his spirit from this cause. Nor we should imagine would the manners of the people in the back parts be found very agreeable or polished. It is admitted on all hands both by those who are favourable and those who are unfavourable to the Americans that if there is not as in Europe gross ignorance and debasement on the one hand neither is there on the other any thing much exalted above the ordinary level. But the inferences which arise from this established fact are strongly in favour of Europe. The grossness of vice and ignorance carries a sure antidote to its corruptions in the disgust which it excites : such examples are not so potent to debase as examples of a different sort are to purify and exalt. There is little risk that society will be contaminated by what is low and debased ; but on the other hand there is a certainty that what is exalted and illustrious in literature science taste accomplishments or fashion will exercise a powerful influence on the general state of manners. We naturally copy what we admire and those great and shining examples constitute a standard to which the whole system of life and manners has a tacit reference. In the United States they have no such models – they do not aim at so high a standard and taste and manners are therefore necessarily at a lower ebb than in Europe – Hence all accounts agree in reprobating the extreme filthy habits which universally prevail ; and Cobbett who will be suspected of too great partiality to this country draws a contrast between the inhabitants of Hampshire and those of the United States in which he places this vice of the American manners in strong colours ; and he adds as his reason for this that they have no gentlemen's seats with the fine improvements of pleasure grounds &c. dispersed through the country as models of taste and neatness for the inferior classes and it is to the same principles that we may trace other defects in their manners namely that they have no proper models on which to form themselves. Hence excepting in the principal cities we may safely conclude from all the information we have received on the subject that society has not reach the same degree of refinement as in this country. An emigrant accustomed to live in Britain would also feel the disavantages of American society strong in this that here in so closely peopled a community surrounded with all sorts of refinements life is assisted by such a variety of helps that it glides down the smooth stream of comfort and convenience without ever meeting with a single interruption. It is astonishing to what a pitch of improvement a society is brough abounding in wealth and in all the mechanical arts and where the ingenuity of thousands is incessantly on the rack to set on foot new devices for the common good. We are not duly sensible of the advantages of this because like other advantages they are familiar to us by long habit and we begin to imagine that they are inherent in the natural constitution of things. But when we are suddenly transplanted into a new community abounding indeed in subsistence but deficient in all comforts – where only the coarsest mechanic arts are practised – where the inhabitants are so widely dispersed that their common exertions cannot be made available for the common good we find life interrupted at every turn. In our former society if we had not the previous secret of transmuting all things into gold we had at least the power of transmuting gold into every thing else. But here the power of money is limited. We must indeed pay for services but we must also beg for them ; and thus we go on fretting and tormenting ourselves under petty incommodities which in this country would be remedied as soon as they were felt. It is incon ceivable how much inconvenience and discomfort and real unhappiness may spring from this cause. In this country by long habit and pracrice and continual improvement every thing has fallen into its right place – each individual has a separate task assigned him in the joint task of labouring for the general benefit – and the industry of all however variously directed tends to one common end. There is a perfect unity of effort. We all labour in common – we combine our efforts that they may yield the largest possible produce and this produce is accurately shared among the various members of the community each receiving the share to which his labour entitles him. Such is substantially the process by which commerce diffuses the benefits of industry over every civilized community. – Money is the instrument by which this division is effected. Every one who labours has the value of his labour ascertained in money which is a draft upon the common stock for whatever quantity of necessaries and luxuries he is entitled to ; and all these complicated operations are executed with a regularity almost mechanical. But in a community newly forming there is a want of unity and combination – all the members labour indeed but no one has his proper part assigned him – there is a jostling and an interference with each other – and when they come to divide some have too much and some too little of certain articles – the stock is ill assorted and money will not execute its functions. Hence disorder arises and inconvience and awkward wants and an individual suddenly removed into this region of discomfort from the happier climate of a highly improved community must be annoyed with feeling in the highest degree gloomy and disagreeable. He must have the same sensation as a person who quits an elegant mansion fitted up with every comfort and convenience for one of inferior quality and coarsely finished where he is exposed to a thousand annoyances every minute. It is observed by Dr Johnson that the evil of life does not consist in any sudden and overwhelming crash of misery but in a series of petty discomforts amd mischiefs continually preying upon the temper. The truth of this maxim those who emigrate from this country to the back woods of America will have a good opportunity of verifying. The prevalence of slavery in most of the States of the Union constitutes another capital defect in the structure of American society. These slaves form a degraded and oppressed class and in the tyranny exercised over them they themselves are morally destroyed while the corruption extends to the other orders of society equally infecting the oppressed and the oppressor and debasing the general character and habits of the people. It is vain to talk of liberty while stain of tyranny so deeply infects the domestic manners of a community. There can be no rational liberty unless we call that liberty which gives us the privilege of torturing and oppressing our fellow creatures. To give an idea of the consequences of this dreadful evil of slavery we may state that it is a practice in Kentucky to commit delinquent slaves into the hands of the public executioner by whom they are unmercifully flogged at the markey cross of the different towns the streets being filled with their pietous cries. What can we think of the people where such spectacles are for a moment tolerated. This is so utterly revolting to every just and enlightened feeling that to a European it would form a strong objection to his permanent residence in that country. In all the northern states and in some of the new states particularly that of the Ohio slavery is indeed abolished. But in several others the black form a large proportion of the population and they are not decreasing. We know indeed that this evil is admitted in its full extent by all the American statesmen that they lament it but do not well see what measures can be adopted to check it. The importation of new slaves is indeed prohibited but the increase of those already in the country is the great grievance against which it is difficult to devise a remedy and the cruel and oppressive treatment which slaves will always meet with wherever they exist must tend to degrade the habits and moral feelings of the community at large. To such therefore as are accustomed to European society where no such strain of tyranny infects the domestic manners an exchange into a community where his feelings may be revolted by spectacles of gross cruelty cannot be regarded as very desirable. If more imperious considerations permit they have certainly a greater chance for happiness by remaining where the rights of nature are respected than by removing to a society where every principle of humanity is trampled upon. ,settlement description;emigration;wages;disease;national characteristics;slavery
   ID134,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1819,1,2,persuade,Emigration to America. In answer to the remarks which appeared in our paper on Monday last respecting emigration to America and to the statements there given of the disadvantages which emigrants from this country might expect to meet with we have received a very abusive letter from an anonymous correspondent who appears very angry and like most other angry men seems more anxious to give full vent to his wrath than to assign any good reason for it. His first cause of quarrel is that we have stated the general want of cleanliness to be a prevailing defect in the back parts of the United States. For this we have the authority of almost every traveller who has visited those parts. The remarks of Birkbeck on this point are conclu-sive and striking: – ' In viewing the Americans (he observes) and ' sketching in a rude manner as I pass along ' their striking characteristics I have seen a de' formity so general that I cannot help esteem' ing it national though I know it admits of ve' ry many individual exceptions. I have written ' it and then erased it wishing to pass it by ' but it wont do – it is the truth and to the truth ' I must adhere. Cleanliness in houses and too ' often in person is neglected to a degree which ' is very revolting to an Englishman. ' America was bred in a cabin ; this is not a ' reproach – for the origin is most honourable ; ' but as she has exhanged her hovel of unhewn ' logs for a framed building and that again for ' a mansion of brick some of her cabin habits ' have been unconsciously retained. Many have ' already been quitted and one by one they will ' all be cleared away as I am told they are now ' in the cities of the eastern states. ' There are I believe court-houses which ' are also made us of as places of worship in ' which filth of all kinds has been accumulating ' ever since they were built. What reverence ' can be felt for the majesty of religion or of ' the laws in such styles of abomination ? The ' people who are content to assemble in them ' can scarcely respect each other. Here is a bad ' public example. It is said that to clean those ' places is the office of no one. But why is no ' person appointed ? Might it not be inferred ' that a disregard to the decencies of life prevails ' through such a community?' To the same purpose Cobbett complains of the ' general (for there are many exceptions) sloven' liness about the homsteads and particularly ' about the dwellings of labourers. Mr Birkbeck ' complains of this and indeed what a contrast ' with the homesteads and cottages which he left ' behind him near the exemplary spot Guild' ford in Surrey.' He then proceeds to give the reasons for this. When the first settlers took possession of the country the ' example of neat' ness (he observes) was wanting. There were ' no gentlemn's gardens kept as clean as ' drawing-rooms with grass as even as a car' pet. From endeavouring to imitate perfec' tion men arrive at mediocrity ; and those who ' never have seen or heard of perfection in these ' matters will naturally be slovens.' He afterwards remarks – ' The market day at Guildford is a perfect ' show of cleanliness. Not even a carter without ' even a clean smock-frock and closely shaven ' and clean washed face. Well may Mr Birkbeck ' who came from this very spot think the people ' dirty in the western country. I'll engage he ' finds more dirt upon the necks and faces of one ' family of his present neighbours than he left ' behind upon the skins of all the people in ' the three parishes of Guildford. However he ' would not have found this to be the case in ' Pennsylvania and especially in those parts where ' the Quakers abound ; and I am told that in ' the New England States the people are as ' cleanly and as neat as they are in England. ' The sweetest flowers when they become pu' trid stink the most and a nasty woman is the ' nastiest thing in nature.' In answer to all this our correspondent tells us that the Scotch are very dirty. This we admit was formerly and may still continue in some degree to be the reproach of the Scotch. But does this reasonable person mean to argue from this that dirty habits are amiable and ought not to be corrected. With regard to the difficulties of effecting a settlement we are borne out in our remarks on this subject by the authority of various writers and principally by the autheor of the Emigrant's Guide a work of great merit which combines an extent and precision of statistical information altogether unequally with the most enlarged general views of the state of the country both physical and moral. ' Most men (observes ' this judicious writer) on arriving in the United ' States expects too much. Perhaps the only ' essential advantages offered are the security of ' person and property and the cheapness of land. ' It demands excessive labour severe economy ' and exepmtions from extraordinary accident to ' succeed in a newly settled country ; and it de' mands the permanency of this continued la' bour prudence and favourable circumstances.' Our anonymous correspondent is also extremely displeased that we have stated so strongly the perincious effects produced on the general manners of the Americans by the existence of slavery ; and he mentions that many a labourer in this country might envy the condition of an American slave. What are those privileges for which a free man should envy a slave he does not think proper to state. To show however that we have not exaggerated the degradation and oppression of the coloured class in the United States we shall again adduce the authority of the Emigrant's Guide. The author is contradicting the notion that the labourer in the slave States is confounded with the negroe ; and he expresses himself in the following terms: – ' A residence of 16 years in places where sla' very is prevalent enables us to contradict a ' general expression that in such places whites ' performing manual labour are confounded in ' the moral estimates of the people with slaves. ' Though less respect is certainly paid to useful ' labour in the slave states than where all the ' duties are performed by whites yet ' the distance between the two races of men are ' in all cases immense. So deep profound and ' inveterate is the feeling on that subject that ' not any where in the United States can pro' perty sobriety intelligence and every other ' advantage expect colour raise in public opi' nion a man the most remotely allied to the ' African to a rank equal to the meanest white. ' Any person who resides a few years in Louisi' ana will be witness to some very remarkable ' exemplifications of this innate contempt for all ' those who affinity involve them in the con' tumely heaped upon men degraded by slavery.' What a picture is here conveyed of misery and degradation on the one hand and of tyranny on the other. – Here we find it failry confessed that no degree of worth whether moral or intel lectual not even the possession of property can give a man the least degree of consideration in the eyes of the privileged class. We cannot conceive a community more wretchedly constituted. All that is estimable and worthy is here utterly contemned because the individual who possesses these qualities happens to have his skin of a particular colour and thus a merely accidental quality of the corporeal frame entails upon its unhappy possessor everlasting ignominy and contempt. These distinctions carried to such an excess seem to us to be founded on the extinction of every generous and honourable sentiment and we cannot help still asserting that we had rather live we at present are than in a community where such hateful antipathies rule to the exclusion of every just and humane feeling. With regard to the condition of the negroe slaves we shall quote a passage from Brown's Western Gazetteer or Emigrant's Directory after reading which we shall leave our anonymous correspondent to say whether he thinks the condition of a labourer in this country preferable to that of being an African slave. The writer describing the town of Lexington in Kentucky observes – ' In this square stands the market-house ' which is of brick and well furnished on Wed' nesdays and Saturdays ; but occasionally the ' scene of a barbarous practise ; for it is here ' that incorrigible or delinquent negroes are ' flogged unmercifully. I saw this punishment ' inflicted on two of these wretches. Their ' screams soon collected a numerous crowd ; I ' could not help saying to myself These cries ' are the knell of Kentucky libery.' Having made this answer to the angry charges thus brought against us we have only to disclaim in the strongest terms all hostility or prejudice against the Americans. We have no wish either to depreciate their character or institutions. They exhibit the interesting spectacle of a nation advancing with an irresistible pace to wealth and greatness. To revile such a people would be the height of human folly and equally foolish is it for their blind admirers to take offence because endeavour to make a fair estimate of their character without hiding any of its defects. ,emigration;settlement description;national characteristics;newspapers;slavery
   ID145,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1819,6,28,persuade,Emigration. The increased population of this country as well as the great difficult to which the middling classes of society are exposed in their efforts to procure the ordinary means of sustenance has given rise to the formation of little copartnerships or joint stock companies of individuals who being unable to command capital enough singly to encounter the expences of a new settlement have put their little funds together with a determination to sail for America and there jointly to labour for the general good of the whole until fortune shall so far favour their efforts as to enable them to become independent of each other. By this means much less than the hundred pounds stipulated by Mr Birkbeck as the proper stock for an emigrant to begin with will be sufficient ; and thus a new impetus will be given to that tide of huma beings which is constantly flowing towards the new world. Would it not be policy to give encouragement to these industrious swarms to settle in our own colonies? We have heard with some pleasure in rumour that several parishes have taken into their serious consideration the prudence of establishing a fund for the encouragement of those poor persons who may be dispoed to seek a means of occupation in Canada ; in furtherance of which laudable design an application is to be made to Government for grants of land in desirable siutations especially in Upper Canada where the climate is described to be of the finest description. There is no doubt that many who are now pining in workhouses would gladly accept of such an alternative and who instead of being as at present a burthen to themselves and to society would by their exertions be adding to the importance and stability of our possessions in that quarter as well as opening a new source for the consumption of our manufactures. ,undefined
   ID153,Aberdeen Journal,Aberdeen,Scotland,United Kingdom,1819,9,22,persuade,Emigration to the Cape of Good Hope. (From Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine.) The Chancellor of the Exchequer has submitted to Parliament the expediency of voting t50000 towards the encouragement of emigration to the Cape of Good Hope. Let it be remembered once for all that it is not because that colony is too thin of inhabitants but that the mother country is too full that this plan is suggested. The question is not how you maintain a surplus peasantry in the land that gave them birth but whether you will stop emigration to the frozen shores of Canada and to the United States or divert and encourage it to the finest colony in the world – We surely have learnt enough of North America to convince us of the degraded and miserable conditions of its people. South African on the other hand has every advantage to repay the sacrifice of quitting the land of our forefathers. The more fully to understand and appreciate these advantages we shall set before our readers a short view of the conditions and facilities of the colony in question. The spring from September to December is the most agreedable season. The summer from December to March is often intensely hot. The autumn from March to June is generally fine and pleasant. The winter is rainy and stormy and for the most part so cold as to make fires very comfortable during the months of July August and September. Most of the diseases that appear among the natives proceed rather from their gross and indolent modes of living than the unheathliness of the climate. The scarcity of water in summer is unfavourable to cultivation ; and for want of industry or materials this defect is not remedied as it is in India by artificial tanks or reservoirs. Whenever however irrigation can be employed either from wells or rivers the most abundant vegetation ensues. Good and abundant water has always been found by digging wells in Cape Town and the vicinity. In the whole colony there is scarcely a river that can be called navigable. Though swollen into torrents during the winter most of them dry up during the summer. All the rivers are well stocked with perch eels and small turtle ; and with a certain distance from the coast they abound with the several fish peculiar to these seas. There is general want of wood in South Africa – At the distance however of 1.5 miles from Algoa bay there is a large forest of a many thousand acres. Some of these trees (taxus elongatus) grow to the amazing size of 10 feet in diameter and to the height of 30 or 40 feet of trunk clear of branches. The wood is useful for many purposes but will not bear exposure to weather. The iron-wood grows to the size of 3 feet in diameter and the trunk straight and very high – The Hassayni wood is a beautiful tree... The Constantia wine is known throughout Europe and to what perfection the other wines of the colony are capable of being brought may very fairly be augured for the great improvement that has already taken place in its manufacture. Heretofore the Dutch farmer and the merchant have regarded more the quantity than the quality of their wine. And when a cargo was once shipped it mattered little to them whether sound or sour it reached its destination. Little care was taken in the growth of the vine ; the branches were permitted to rest upon the groun ; while decayed and unripe grapes stalks and leaves were all promiscuously thrown in the wine-press. The mode also of seasoning the casks with brimstone and the want of good brandy to fit it for foreign markets have all contributed to deteriorate the character and confine the sale of Cape Madeira. These defects have lately been in a great measure remedied. Proper persons have been sent out from Madeira and this country and every care seems now taken to meet and secure the growing demand in European markets. The trifling duty affixed to Cape Madeira in this country has been the means of introducing it into many families which have hitherto used home-made wines. And though the merchants at Madeira have made many remonstrances on this preference it surely is but equitable that encouragement should be given to the stape export of a colony now decidely and we must trust unalterably English. But in addition to wines there are other articles of colonial growth exported to the East Indies Europe and America. Grain wool bides and skins whale oil and bone dried fruits salt provisions soap and candles aloes tobacco. Such are the articles of commerce that might be turned to the best account. – But neither trade nor prosperit of any kind will continue to thrive in this colony under the present mode of administering its government and laws. It has been said that despotism would be the best of governments were the despot virtuous. This may be ; but contituted as human nature is we fear that the purest amongst us needs some control. Control however there is none over the governor at the Cape. He makes and annuls laws at pleasure. He inserts a proclamation in the Cape Gazette and from that moment his fiat becomes the law of the land. He has indeed an adviser in the colonial secretary whose influence does not extend beyond that of mere advice. Strange to add the laws at the Cape are at this moment Dutch laws rescinded and obscured by all the edicts of the different governors of the colony. All pleadings are in writing and were till laterly carried on foribus clausis. In 1797 a court of appeal for criminal and civil cases was established over both of which the governor presides. In India in the West Indies and in Canada there is a governor and a council. These act as checks upon each other. But at the Cape there is no appeal beyond the governor. The taxes however at the Cape under which we groan so painfully in this country are comparatively trifling. European luxuries very justly pay a heavy import duty but their purchase is matter of choice.– This falls not upon the poor not consequently will it fall upon those most likely to emigrate under the provisions of the Parliamentary grant. Noting indeed can be framed with greater care and precautions than the encouragement bedd out in Mr Vansittuart's proposal. A small deposit L. 10. is to be made at the colonial office in Downing Street by each individual. A free passage is to be granted and on reaching the Cape this deposit is to be returned to the settler by the local government. And such is the liberality that has guided the proposed plans it is moreover stipulated that if 100 families should agree to emigrate and their minister with them not only permission will be granted them so to do but provision will be made for him. The separation from country and from kindred is thus softened and it will allay many a sorrowing regret and painful recollection that in distant lands and amongst a strange people the settler may still listen to the voice and instruction of a pastor to whom custom veneration and affection have all united to attach him. It appears that the experiment of a settlement of English has already been made upon a limited plan at Saldanha Bay (the finest harbour in South Africa) : and with such success as to give the best encouragement to a more extensive emigration. Indeed from what we have outselves seen of the colony and its great facilities we have no doubt whatever of the benefits that must arise to the sober steady exertions of the industrious. At the Cape or elsewhere poverty and misery will attend the vicious and indolent but certain we are that there is no country under heaven where the poor may find a safer asylum and where activity economy and good conduct will meet with so certain and full a reward. During the stay of the 93rd regiment of foot (a Scotch regiment) at the Cape many of the privates were known to save the whole of their pay and were thus enabled to return to England with a very hand some little fortune. English servants of all descriptions are in great request and 1.5 sterling a month are no uncommon wages for a tolerable cook. It is nevertheless to beremember that clothes of all kinds are expensive at the Cape as no manufactory is permitted lest it should injure the trade of this country. Still farmers in the country dress very coarsely and cheaply ; and their wives and daughters except on Sunday are humbly clad as themselves. Indeed in so soft a climate as the Cape there is that occasion for multiplicity and warmth of apparel which colder regions require. For three-fourths of the year the best bed is a hard mattress with a single coverlet. There is point which we cannot pass over ; as we think it very intimately connected with the virtue and happiness of the settlers. And that is the education of their children. Nothing is more neglected than this in Southern Africa. The boors (farmers) are ignorant to a degree passing credence. With the minister that is to accompany 100 families it would be highly expedient to send a few sober intelligent men as schoolmasters. Attempts have been lately made to introduce into the colony the Madras system of instruction and a free school upon that plan has been established at Cape Town with considerable success. Still the natives are stubbornly averse to instruction. Their luxurious and bountiful climate supplies them with all the necessaries of human life and beyond this they have neither wish nor ambition. But if knowledge has its fruits ignorance has its weeds. The savage and unparalleled cruelties that have heretofore been exercised towards their slaves and the Hottentot servants by these Dutch boors may very fairly be traced to want of education as a main cause. The unjust limits shown by the Dutch laws to the white man's barbarities have doubtless encouraged their perpetration – Cruelty is not the character of Englishmen and therefore too much care cannot be taken to guard the families of the new settlers against the contagion of the inhumanities that they must see practised around them and how far an early and thorough acquaintance with our duty to God and man will counteract this influence aided a knowledge of common school attainments we need not say. The We have thrown these remarks together more as loose hints for the consideration of our readers than with any idea of furnishing a complete view of so wide and important a subject. We may be induced hereafter to review the question more in detail. The plan itself as confessed by the Chanceller of the Exchequer has at present assumed a very imperfect shape. Americe we have not seen and can only speak from the reports of other. Those reports are sufficiently discouraging. On the contrary all who have seen and described the Cape have united in praising it. Food is cheap and abundant the price of labour is exceedingly high trade is important and increasing many parts of the colony are beautiful and its climate is mild and healthy. There are few countries upon earth where so many components of happiness will be found to concentrate. ,undefined
   ID164,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1820,5,20,persuade,Necessity of Legislative Measures for Relieving the Distress of the Labouring Classes. Salus populi suprema lex. T here wasa time when it was held pure factiousness to doubt whether the prosperity we enjoyed during the first ten or twelve years of the late war was perfectly sound and natural and whether it would not ultimately entail upon us a corresponding share of future calamity. But the most gloomy anticipations of those who were most inclined to view the picture on the dark side have certainly come infinitely short of the full measure of distress and misery which have at length fallen upon the country. It would be unjust to charge the Government with any more of these evils than might have been foreseen ; but now that they force themselves on the attention on all sides it is perfectly fair to hold the Government accountable for all that it can remove or prevent and yet suffers to exist. This is the first time we believe in modern history when the evil of an excess of population has come so distinctly under the notice of a Government as to call for a legislative remedy. The case is therefore new and the course to be pursued is the less obvious ; but the war was a season of bold experiments in which we surmounted many difficulties once deemed insuperable : and if timidity tie up our hands now when humanity calls upon us to move the world may well say that the boasted energy of the Government has been entirely reserved for the supply of its own wants out of the pockets of the people but that when a period of public calamity requiress exertions of a more painful kind it is startled by the smallest difficulty and will not even make such a slight effort as might evince its sympathy with the sufferers. During the late war the industry of the country was stimulated into a state of unprecedented activity by the monopoly we obtained of the commerce of the world–by thirty or forty millions of the capital of the country being annually melted down and consumed–and by the continual rise of prices produced by the depreciation of the currency. The great demand for labour arising out of this state of things with the consequent increase of wages caused a rapid augmentation in the numbers of the people. In the ten years ending 1811 the rate of increase in Britain was such as would have doubled the population in fifty-two years; and in the great manufacturing districts it probably equalled what takes place in a new colony. When the peace came and was followed by the destruction of our commercial monopoly the cessation of the annual loans and the diminuition of the paper issues the sources of our fictitious prosperity were dried up at once : a vast reduction took place in the demand for labour ; profits and wages fell with prices ; while the pressure of the taxes were doubled and onethird added to their real amount by the rise in the value of money. The laws however which regulate the multiplication of human beings cannot instantly bend to circumstances : a long period necessarily elapses before the population accommodates itself to the diminished demand for labour and during this period the labouring classes must suffe extreme misery. In this state we are at present and time from which we hoped relief has only aggravated the evil. There are but three remedies upon which any dependence can be placed – a reduction of taxation – a change in our commercial system – and emigration. We have little hopes as to the first since this would require a sacrifice on the part of the Government of its own interest real or supposed which we see no disposition to make. A relaxation in our restrictive commercial system has not the same obstacles to encounter and we have repeated shewn that it would be highly beneficial. The reluctance of Ministers to attempt a change that may prejudice the interest of some particular classes might be considered as a prudent caution were it not observed that when instead of relieving the distress of the people the object is to suppy the necessities of the Treasury none of this caution appears but the complaints of the sufferers are disregarded as vulgar clamour. But the crisis is now such that tenderness to the interests of a few individuals may be cruelty to the public at large. Though we shall preach free trade to other nations rather with a bad grace when we can no longer hold our monopoly it is so far well that our misfortunes are at last likely to open our eyes to truths whch were familiar to philosophers half a century ago. In our present circumstances we may perhaps almost be thankful that a systematic error which has impeded our career has kept this one resource open to us. Emigration suggests itself so naturally as a remedy for a redundant population that we are rather surprised there should be much reluctance to have recourse to it. We need not be afraid that the practise will continue longer than the necessity which produces it. The vis intertiae of people in general says Malthus and their attachment to their homes are qualities so strong and general that we may rest assured they will not emigrate unless from political discontents or extreme poverty they are in such a state as will make it as much for the advantages of their country as of themselves that they should go out of it. We by no means underrate the difficulties that attend emigration upon a large scale but these are partly occasioned by the absurd practise of directing it exclusively to our own colonies. We have vast multitudes whom we can neither feed nor employ ; and surely the first and most pressing object is to send them where they will find the means of subsistence. There are many parts of the world besides our own colonies open to receive them. And whether they go to the United States Brazil Buenos Ayres or to Canada New Holland or the Cape of Good Hope the advantage to this country will be nearly the same. Among so many countries of such extent it would not be very difficult to dispose of half a million of persons (young and old) within the course perhaps of two years. But upon whatever scale emigration is conducted it must be gradual; and this renders it the more important to fix upon a plan early. Ministers have lately announced that Canada cannot receive more emigrants at present without inconvenience. But had the intention of sending great numbers to that colony been made public two years ago corn would have been raised for them and men of some capital assured of finding abundance of labourers would have gone out and settled and provided employment for those who have not the means to establish themselves as farmers. The alarm we feel of seeing manufactures raised up in other countries by the skill of our expatriated artisans is very ill founded. Many other advantges must be combined with the possession of mechanical skill to make manufactures flourish ; and when the former are found able workmen will not be long wanting. Our capital our improved means of internal communication our coal fields our laws for the protection of industry and property the free enlightened and active spirit of our people with the powers of combination resulting from the union of so many advantages within so small a space are better securities for our superiority in manufactures than attempts which must be nugatory to retain a monopoly of operative skill and talent. But the opinion which exists in foreign countries as to the superiority of our people in every branch of industry will have this good effect that it will secure out emigrants a favourable reception. Though the emigration to afford any sensible relief to the whole country would require to be upon an extensive scale it is yet obvious that even upon the smallest scale it is beneficial. If six labourers are withdrawn from a small village or fifty from a country town the situation of either will be improved. The plan hitherto acted on by Government of givingassistance to those only who could raise ten on fifteen pounds is chiefly objectionable because it must restrict the emigration within very narrow limits. If by sending away men who are still able to subsist by their labour others now living on charity get employment we are in effect relieved of so many paupers. But the former are less disposed to leave the country ; and with regard to those who are or must soon become paupers it will certainly be found more economical to pay ten or fiften pounds each to send them abroad than to maintain them permanently home. It is in vain however to look to private charity for the funds necessary for such an undertaking. These must be raised by the country at large ; and whether a tax be imposed for the special purpose or money destined for other objects be applied to this the country we have no doubt is ready to make the sacrifice. Suppose that even so great a sum as five millions were required this is but the half of what England alone pays every year for poor rates ; and what is such a sum if it were to afford certain relief on an emergency lke the present? If the French and Dutch should again disagree about the navigation of the Scheldt or if we should quarrel with the French or Americans about the traffic in a few hundred wild cat-skins on the other side of the globe how easily would a sum ten times as large be found? Nothing more is requisite than to take on half of the sum for two years which Mr Vansittart allots for paying off the national debt. We not only conceive that it would be wise and creditable to divert a part or the whole of the actual Sinking Fund to this purpose ; but we go so far as to think that it is little less than disgraceful to pay off any debt at all at this crisis with funds wrung from the earnings of a starving population. Whatever is done it is of vast importance to understand that the most pressing evil though not absolutely permanent in its nature cannot be expected to subside of itself for many years. We have not only an excess of population to dispose of but we have to check the principle of increase which is rapidly aggravating the evil. In the five years ending 1810 the population of England added one-seventieth part to its numbers annually ; and if we suppose the ratio to have been the same for the whole empire each year must have had 250000 individuals more to provide for than the preceding. Till the whole of this vast annual inrease is got rid of the present excess of numbers will not diminish but augment. And how is it to be got rid of? Either the annual births must diminish more than one-third or famine and disease must destroy a quarter of a million of human beings annually beyond the usual rate of mortality or these two causes must operate together. Notwithstanding therefore the misery of the labouring classes at this moment we doubt whether the population is not still on the increase and whether still more afflicting scenes are not awaiting us. Indeed unless measures are taken to do away the factitious stimulus which the English poorlaws give to the increase of population the most abundant e migration will prove but a feeble palliative. These are rather discouraging circumstances ; but the evil must be dealt with in some way or it will ultimately overwhelm us. It has now become rather a question of humanitiy than of policy. One or two millions of human beings have been suddenly deprived of their means of subsistence by events over which they had no control. With such a mass of individuals goaded to desperation by want–a deficient crop–a sudden revulsion in trade– a more general exclusion of our manufactures by the Americans–any of those numerous casualties in short to which every nation is exposed would place us in a situation frightful to contemplate. Plots and insurrections will keep up a continual alarm. Neither persons nor property will be safe and capital will gradually leave the country. If theory were silent experience must now convince us that time alone will produce no material amelioration in our circumstances ; and the relief which is may ultimately bring will be obtained only through the destruction of vast multitudes by famine and disease. In the fifth year of peace it is now time to look the evil in the face and either to make some great sacrifices for its removal or to brace our minds to bear the dreadful alternative. It is in vain to disguise the matter to our own consciences. Those who propose to leave things to what they call the course of nature are in substance recommending that thousands of their fellow-creatures should be suffered to rot away from the effect of absolute want. That such a thing should take place in the ,undefined
   ID196,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1824,3,27,persuade,Prison Discipline. The Fifth Report of the Committee of the Society for the Improvement of Prison Discipline &c.–1823. With an Appendix &c. T his Report only reached us yesterday ; but the Society brings so much benevolence into activity under the guidance of practical wisdom aided by very enlightened views of the best interests of society that we consider any delay improper in calling the attention of the public to their valuable proceedings. The present Report abounds with evidence that they have not relaxed in their exertions. At home not only are the laws improving but the magistracy are carrying improvements into all the practical departments. A great many jails designed on much better principlpes are in progress in different parts of the country ; and in those which are used it may be said generally that much more attentions is paid to health cleanliness diet employment and classification. It must not be thought however that nothing remains to be done. There are still jails in which prisoners are double ironed and chained to the floor of their cels from night to morning ; others in which persons committed for trial are fettered with irons of the weight of from seven to nine pounds ; and others in which debtors are exposed to the contaminating society of criminals in which neither the various classes of prisoners nor the two sexes are kept separate from each other and in which all are allowed to be idle. The Magistrates of Surrey have provided a covered vehicle for conveying prisoners to the Sessions'house ; but in the metropolis it would appear the practise still continues of inflicting public degradation on parties arraigned or merely suspected of crime by marching them handcuffed through the streets of London ; and very recently a party of one hun- dred prisoners were marched for a mile handcuffed through the open streets in order to be formally set at liber- ty by proclamation ! So much for metropolitan decorum ! These shameful exhibitions and practises cannot however long maintain their ground ; the publicity given to them through the proceedings of the Society should of itself be enough to do them away ; but while they are continued England should be somewhat chary of her boasts. The views and principles of the Prison Society are attracting notice and gaining ground in France Switzerland the Netherlands Hanover Bavaria Wurtemberg Denmark Norway Sweden and Russia. At Christiana the Magistrates have already resolved on the erection of a new city gaol. In St Petersburgh the prisoners are now furnished with food clothing baths and medical assistance. A Ladies' Association under the patronage of the Princess Mesthersky is also in full activity at St Petersburgh ; and there is an auxiliary prison society at Orel on the very frontiers of Siberia. Seven thousand prisoners passed through Orel last year ; but their chains have been lightened and their condition meliorated generally through the exertions of the Russian Society. For details however we must refer to the Report itself ; but we cannot take leave of it without making special notice of the benefits conferred on society by the Female Associations and Temporary Refuge. The almost miraculous power of kindness when accompanied as genuine kindness often is with quiet feeling and unobtrusive goodness continues to be exemplified in the Ladies' Committee of which Mrs Fry we believe is still at the head. In Newgate idleness dissipation and licentiousness have been succeeded by industry order and restraint ; and the same committee accomplish much good by visiting the ships in which convicts are embarked for New South Wales. Arrangements are thus made for the formation of schools for moral and religious instruction during the voyage and the convicts are furnished not only with suitable clothing and other necessaries but the means of employment in the manufacture of such articles as may be readily sold for their relief on arriving at the colony. These are truly good works ; and too much praise cannot be bestowed on the Ladies by whom they are performed. It is gratifying to observe that Female Associations for visiting prisons have been established in Bedford Bristol Carlisle Colchester Derby Dumfries Durham Exeter Lancaster Nottingham Plymouth York and Glasgow. We had once thought that by this time we might have added Edinburgh ; and we are inclined to hope that the present Lord Provost will yet employ his influence in establishing a Lady's Society for the prisons of our Metropolis.– There too we had cherished and still cherish the hope of seeing a House of Refuge. The temporary refuge of the Prison Society is chiefly for affording relief to distressed boys who on their discharge from the prisons of the metropolis have expressed a desire to abandon their criminal courses. Many of these are in circumstances of urgent want ; and the Committee can now look round wtih pleasure on many who are variously settled and conducting them- selves exemplarily. In the temporary refuge they are trained up to habits of industry instructed in moral and religious duty and after a time are provided with suitable situations. There is a great similarity in the histories of the individuals admitted into this asylum ; but the greater number obviously consists of boys who had been almost driven to commit petty thefts from want of employment or destitution or who from neglect or loss of parents had fallen into the company of professed thieves. The Committee mention that on one recent occasion no less than eight boys were released from Newgate in one day and immediately after they had undergone the sentence of flogging which upon some insane rule is usually carried into effect on the day of their discharge. Their persons are thus marked with the stigma of guilt and from soreness and want of strength they are disabled from working at the very time they ought to go in search of employment. No more effectual plan could have been devised to irritate these boys against society to prevent them from obtaining employment though desirous of it or to impel them to recommence their career of crime. We entreat those who are inclined to look upon what they call a smart whipping as the only corrective for juvenile offences to reflect a little on the consequences to which their system inevitably tends. We are decidedly and in all cases against the deliberate infliction of pain merely to be felt as such. In the case of children if not necessary for that purpose it will certainly give them the idea of power superior to their own and may thus be the means of constraining more readily than otherwise ; but the law when it inflicts pain has always other means of evincing its power and constraining those who are within its grasp. Its most important function is to prevent crime ; its next is o convince those who comit offences that the means of detection are on the whole so sure that nothing is to be gained by the commission ; and its next to make restitution onerous and complete. There may also be some classes of criminals who ought to be considered and treated as mad –some are curable ; and some as incurably furious who must either be cut off altogether or confined for life. We are not opposed to the infliction of punishments because in our opinion the most effectual of those will be found to consist in the best means of preventing or remedying the evils produced by crime. All exposures restraints constraints and compulsory reparations are punishments. We are only hostile to the infliction of pain for no other purpose but because pain is produced. If it can be made obvious to the sufferers that the pain inflicted protects others or affords true reparation for the wrongs done to them or society we shall then grant that such punishments may be both just and expedient. The Prison Society while they vindicate themselves temperately but firmly from the charge of having yielded to a sort of blind and irrational benevolence and advocated measures which went to raise the condition of prisoners above that of common labourers do still seem to us to have been too much moved by the coarse jokes and reckless speculations of a clever essayist. If they err at all they seem now to be somewhat too indulgent to the advocates of hard labour and severe punishments. We are rather inclined to think them too decidely in favour of the tread mill which they allow has been so worked or constructed at different places as to form very unequal measures of punishment and they very properly insist that every tread-mill should be provided with a regulator by which its rate of revolution may at all times be restrained within safe limits and a dial-register (lately invented by Mr Bate instrumentmaker to the Board of Excise) by which the rate of labour may be at any time accurately ascertained and which ( they think ) should in no case exceed 12000 feet in ascent for one day. There is an able argument in the report against compelling persons to labour who are merely imrpisoned for trial : and there is a great mass of curious and useful information in the Appendix. ,undefined
   ID265,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1836,12,7,persuade,South Australia We have received the first annual Report of new colony of South Australia a Parliamentary paper presented in June last. The site selected for the colony is a part of the south coast of New Holland extending two or three hundred miles on each side of Spencer's Gulf and about 600 miles into the interior. It was anticipated that the best central station would be Port Lincoln at the entrance of Spencer's Gulf on the west side or Nepean Bay on the north coast of Kangaroo Isle. Port Lincoln is in latitude 35 and east longitude 136 about 700 miles right west from Sydney the same distance north-west from Van Diemen's Land and about 1000 miles eastward of the colony at King George's Sound. Nepean Bay is about 100 miles east from Port Lincoln. The colony is established under Parliamentary Commissioners as an experiment we believe to try whether it may not be possible to execute an extensive plan of emigration without any charge to the country by selling lots of land at such a price as would defray the expense of conveying the emigrants from England. The plan adopted is to send out preferably young married persons under thirty and to admit no slaves or convicts into the colony. A company has embarked t35000 in the enterprise. A surveying vessel was sent out in March to examine the coast carefully that the best site might be chosen at first and the necessity of removal avoided. Six vessels altogether had sailed down to the 1st May carrying out 152 male labourers with 37 females and 26 male and 10 females of a superior class. These numbers include 26 children. The Commissioners attempted at first to get 20s. per acre for the land ; but finding it impossible they reduced the price to 12s. By selling at this price 437 lots consisting each of a country section of 134 acres and a town section of one acre they had raised the t35000 required by the act of Parliament as the condition of the grant of land. We give these few details to put our readers in a condition to understand the notices which appear from time to time in the papers respecting the colony. We hope the Commissioners or the adventurers will give the country a distinctive name. The title of South Australia is bad any way and even positively absurd ; since Australia ( quasi Australasia) originally intended for New Holland has already begun to be monopolised by Van Diemen's Land. The district at Spencer's Gulf if it is to participated in the general denomination should be termed North rather than South Australia. By the way most of our colonies in that quarter of the world have ridiculous names as is instantly perceived when we coin a nationa term for the people out of them. What can be worse than a Van Diemen-lander ; a New South-Wales-ian ; a Swan River-ite ; or a King-George's Soundian ! ! ,undefined
