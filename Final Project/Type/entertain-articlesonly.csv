   ID6,1789,Cent is the only coinage the Americans have of their won. No less than 300 ton of them were contracted for by Congress in the year 1787 to be coined at the rate of 50 ton per annum ; the contracters were also bound down to make them all of the famous Jersey copper. They are a little larger than the British halfpence. No British copper no passes in the United States;–silver and gold coins of all nations however pass cur rent. The congress have not yet ordered a silver coinage. 
   ID9,1789,Curious Anecdote.–A few days ago a stranger waited on Mr. Sibbly Treasurer of the East India Company and desired to speak to him in private ; when the were retired the stranger said to Mr. Sibbly I am lately returned from India I have smuggled goods to the amount of about 120l. What duty have I to pay upon them? Mr. Sibbly smiled and told him That he could receive no such money without the Chairman's permission. Pray then (said the stranger) speak to him of it as soon as possible. I am resolved to pay whatever the duty is. The Company pays for the exclusive privilege of bringing India goods to Europe; the man that deprives them of any part of the advantages they hope to reap from it cannot in my opinion look upon himself as a strictly honest man. Since the stranger waited on Mr. Sibbly the Chairman had not had time to give him an answer ; the stranger notwithstanding gave him a letter including a Bank note of 30l. The sum Mr. Sibbly told him he should pay if he paid any thing. 
   ID41,1789,Living out of the World To the PRINTER. Sir ABOUT two month ago I went to the country to pay a visit to a friend in a remote county; and though I am much of what may be called a newspaper man I never thought of ordering my papers to be sent down to me. To my utter astonishment my rustic landlord did not take in own newspaper; so there was I stuck down with my friend in the country–knowing no more of what passed in town than if I had been in Lapland. Intending every day should be my last I went on without ordering your or any other paper till two months had passed away at which period I returned to town. And there Sir I was quite a new man and just as if I had dropped down from the clouds. Every day I heard people talking of occurrences of which I knew nothing : Revolutions in France by Fishwomen ; and battles in Flanders against the Emperor who I thought was fighting against the Turks. But even this was not the most distressing–for one day meeting a friend I inquired very cordially after his wife who I found a few days afterwards had eloped just before with another gentleman ; and meeting with a lady I inquired kindly for her sister who I found had departed to the other world a fortnight before. On this account I never will stir again out of the world unless your paper goes along with me. I hold a newspaper to be a kind of viaticum with which every man should be provided and which become the more necessary the further we remove from town It. is the only way to keep pace with what is going on every day in the fashionable or literary world–and to prevent talking about dead friends or wives that have absconded. In short Sir a newspaper is my creed –and never will I again travel without my faith along with me : having fully experienced the unpleasantness of being sent back into the world as ignorant as if I had been born again– I hereby give notice – That if an hottentot friend of mine invites me who does not take in your paper or some other– I will not visit him. DICK DESPERATE.

   ID64,1790,No fewer than nine young ladies are going to the Market of Love in India on board the William Pitt ! What a disgrace to our young men at home ! 
   ID65,1790,By the last letters from India we understand they were going on in the plodding way with nothing new or important.–The markets are overstocked with British goods so as to enable our countrymen to supply themselves with most articles at a cheaper rate than if they were at home ; the credit of the revenue rather upon the increase ; Lord Cornwallis is as strict as ever who is expected to remain another year among them to the no small regret of those who left England for the sake of Oriental wealth. Our female adventurers have also found it a bad market ; British beauty never fails of finding its admirers ; but the late restriction in the East have rendered wives forbidden fruit of which neither civil nor military dare to think of tasting. 
   ID67,1790,Character of the Female Sex. By Mr. Ledyard a celebrated traveller. I have always remarked that women in all countries are civil obliging tender and humane; that they are ever inclined to be gay and cheerful timorous and modest : and that they do not hesitate like men to perform a generous action. Not haughty not arrogant not supercilious they are full of courtesy and fond of society ; more liable in general to err than man but in general also more virtuous and performing more good actions than he. To a woman whether civilized or savage I never addressed myself in the language of decency and friendship without receiving a decent and friendly answer. With men it has been otherwise. In wandering over the barren plains of inhos- pitable Denmark through honest Sweden and fro- zen Lapland rude and churlish Finland unprin- cipled Russia and the widespread regions of the wandering Tartar ; if hungry dry cold wet or sick the women have ever been friendly to me and uniformly so ; and to add to this virtue (so worthy the appellation of benevolence) these actions have been performed in so free and so kind a manner that if I was dry I drank the sweetest draught and if hungry I eat the coarse morsel with a double relish. 
   ID70,1790,A humorous Adventure of a Marriage negotiated by a Bill of Exchange in one of the English West India Islands. A Merchant originally from London having acquired a great fortune in this island concluded with himself he could not be happy in the enjoyment of it unless[?] he shared[?] it with a woman of merit ; and knowing none to his fancy he resolved to write to a worthy correspondent of his in London. He know no other [?] than that he used in his trade ; therefore treating affairs of love as he did his business after giving his friend in a letter several comissions and reserving this for the last he went on thus : Item[?] seeing that I have taken a resolution to marry and that I do not find a suitable match for me here do not fail to send me by next ship bound hither a young woman of the qualifications and form following: As for a portion I demand none ; let her be of an honest family ; between 20 and 25 years of age ; of a middle stature and well proportioned ; her face agreeable her temper mild her character blameless her heatlh good and her constitution strong enough to bear the change of the climate that there may be no occasion to look out for a second through lack of the [?] soon after she comes to hand ; which must be provided against as much as possible considering the great distance and dangers of the sea. If she arrives and conditioned as abovesaid with the present letter endorsed by you or at least an attested copy thereof that there may be no mistake or imposition I hereby oblige and engage myself satisfy the said letter by marrying the [?] at 15 days [?]. In witness [?] [?] I [?] [?] [?]. The London correspondent read over and over the odd article which put the future [?] on the same footing with the bales of good he was to send to his friend ; and after adressing[?] the prudent exactness of the naturalized Creole and his laconic stile in enumerating the qualifications he insisted on he endeavoured to serve him to his mind ; and after many enquiries he judged he had found a lady fit for his purpose in a young person of a reputable family but no fortune ; of good humour and of a polite education ; well shaped and more than tolerably handsome. He made the proposal to her as his friend has directed and the young gentlewoman who had no subsistence but from a cross old aunt who gave her a great deal of uneasiness accepted it. A ship bound for the West Indies was then fitting out at Bristol ; the gentlewoman went on board the same together with the bales of goods being well provided with all necessaries and particularly with a certificate in due form and indorsed by the correspondent. She was also included in the invoice the last article of which ran thus : Item a maid of 21 years of age of the quality shape and conditioned as per order ; as appears by the affadavits and certificates she has to produce. Writings which were thought necessary to so exact a man as the future husband were an extract from the parish register ; a certificate of her character signified by the curate ; an attestation of her neighbours setting forth that she had for the space of three years lived with an old aunt who was intolerably peevish and that she had not during all that time given her said aunt the least occasion of complaint. And li[?]y the goodness of her consitution was certified after [?] by [?] [?]. [?] [?] departure the London correspondent sent several letters of advice by other ships to his friend whereby he informed him that per such a [?] he sent him a young woman of such an age character and condition &c. in a word such [?] desired to marry. The letters of advice the bales and the gentlewoman came safe to the port ; and our Creole who happened to be one[?] of the foremost on the pier and the lady's landing was charmed to see a handsome person who having heard him called by his name told him Sir I have a bill of exchange upon you and you know that it is not usually for people to carry a great deal of money about them in such a long voyage as I have made ; I beg the favour you will pleased to pay it. At the same time she gave him his correspondent's letter on the back of which was wrote The bearer of this is the spouse you ordered me to send you. Ha [?][?] ! said the Creole I never yet suffered my bills to be protested and I swear this shall not be the first : I shall reckon myself the most fortunate of all men if you allow me to discharge it. Yes Sir replied she and the more willingly since I am apprized of your character. We have several persons of honour on board who knew you very well and who during my passage have answered all the questions I asked them concerning you in so advantageous a manner that it has raised in me [?] for you. This first interview was in a few days after followed by the nuptials which were very magnificent. The new married couple are satisfied with their happy union made by [?] of exchange which was the most fortunate that had happened in that island for many years. 
   ID72,1790,A Transfer of Conjugal Love. On Monday last was married at Stockport an inhabitant of Macclesfield to a female on whom he had fixed his affections. It is to be observed that he did not toil through the tedious forms of courtship but at once got a wife as others sometimes get good places by purchase –and as we are informed the lady was valued at eight guineas and thirty yards of Irish cloth at 2s. 6d. per yard–which property he deposited in exchange for earthly treasure. –Whether a wife may be cheap or dear at that price time will shew. Her former husband having seen military service was not to be discomposed at trifles and his philosophy probably being strengthened on the occasion he attended the happy pair to church and saw the marriage ceremony ; after which they spent the evening at the bridegroom's house where all was gaity. The first husband parted with an helpmate had borne his sorrows twelve years ; and the second husband received a partner of his joys after having buried a former one just a week. 
   ID73,1790,Court of Chancery. The King at the relation of the Bishop of Lon don versus Anderson and Gipps. On the 18th of June 1692 the Hon. Mr. Boyle left by will the sum of 5400l. to be laid out in lands in Yorkshire out of the rents of which the sum of 90l. was to be paid annually to the College of William and Mary in New England to be applied for the purpose of propagating the Christian religion amongst the Indians in the back settlements in North America ; and likewise a further sum of 45l. to be paid to the same College for the support of two missionaries to preach the gospel. The city of London were left trustees and the management under the trust was by the will committed to the care of the Bishop of London. The present Bishop instituted this suit in which the city and a great number of other persons were parties for the single and indeed novel purpose of knowing whether (as the teststor had originally devised the several sums for the use of British subjects and the Americans having ceased to be in that situations since their independence) the annuity ought not to revert to this kingdom or to some other of his Majesty's colonies to be applied to similar purposes. This being the first determination of that nature since the American Revolution the Lord Chancellor decided it with that superior dignity of sentiment that always attends his decrees. Two phrases are sufficient– all charitable devices are to be held sacred– we cannot rake up the ashes of the dead in search of latent intentions. The annuities and arrears must be paid and Messrs. Anderson and Gipps and likewise the city of London must be paid their costs.

   ID76,1790,On Tuesday afternoon the six Cherokee Chiefs visited the Cathedral of St. Paul's which they explain with an equal degree of curiosity and amazement. They were asked whether they would not attend the evening service which they readily complied and seemed particularly delighted with the organ. The Cherokee Chiefs having made us an offer of 20000 men gratitude obliges us to make them some acknowledgement whether we accept their offer or not.–We can very well spare them the members of the Halter Club–all our housebreakers highwaymen pick pockets swindlers Faro and E O Table keepers–and all their accomplices to an amazing number. Such a collection would be a truly valuable present.–Among them are found dispersedly all the qualities of able Generals–skilful Financiers –able Negotiators active Citizens–and men highly expert at a Coup de Main. Were we to add the Pugilistic tribe–the Cherokee Chiefs might on their return to their own country enter into a boxing war against their enemies–with a certainty of the most brilliant success. Trading Justices and Lawyers they would perhaps be glad to have ; and it is the opinion of most people that a few thousands of the latter description of men might be spared.

   ID326,1790,New York August 4. On Monday the 12th ult. there was a violent tempest at Leominster Massachusetts attended with hail which was of such a size and fell with such velocity that the stoutest Indian corn was beaten into shreds–vast quantities of apples were beaten from the trees–not only the fruit but the trees received great injury the bark being broken from their limbs; the windows broken in the house and the fences renewed such impressions as to be discovered at 90 yards distance. Many of the hailstones were as large as hens eggs–the common size was a little more than an inch in diameter. Twenty-give hours after it fell banks of it were measured at the foot of a hill and found to be 20 inches deep. The Saturday following great damage was ??? by hail at Shrewsbury country of Worcesster. August 15. On Sunday the 25th July a violent hail storm commenced a few miles to the westward of Wilmington Delaware which did great damage to many fields of grain and blew down in many places an immense quantity of timber. The hail in this storm was of an extraordinary appearance; part of it being about two inches long and of a very considerable circumference. On Saturday the 1st inst. arrived at Wilmington Delaware the brig Maria Capt. fort from Londonderry with 200 passengers. On the 4th inst. arrived at Philadelphia the Happy Return Capt. Ewing in 8 weeks from Londonderry brought 340 passengers in good health: Capt. Ewing parted near the Capes of Delaware with the ship Sally Capt. Miller with passengers from Londonderry for that port also. Pennsylvania July 21. Last Sunday evening Mr. John Garrison son of William Garrison of Newbury township in this county was killed by lightning in his own house. The lightning struck in at the gable and just at the instant that Mr. Garrison was in the centre of the floor walking towards the window; his brother was standing within two yards of him when he fell but providentially received not the smallest hurt. We also learn that Patrick M'Sherry of Little's-town in this county had two cows killed by lightning the same evening. New London July 30. A slight shock of an earthquake was fel tin this and the neighhbouring towns on Sunday morning last about thirty minutes past five o'clock. Middletown July 25. About five o'clock this morning a noise was heard that seemed to pass over this city which is thought to have come from a north-westerly direction and proceeded to a south-easterly one. The noise was equal to loud heavy thunder and the commotion occasioned by it very sensible in the shaking of houses but no damage was done.– The Tuesday preceding about six or seven miles to the southward of this place a similar but heavier noise was heard attended with the like commotion. Extract of a letter from Dartmouth (Connecticut) July 26. Some days ago a house near the college was struck by lightning and a child therein killed. Since that a woman was killed by the same means in Cornish a town adjoining Dartmouth as she sat in her house at work. Later still at Hampton in New York state a yoke of oxen were killed both by one flash of lightning.–From what reason we cannot tell but the lightning has been peculiarly destructive in many of our settle ments during the present summer. It would aphowever that nature is willing to repair those losses; accounts having just come to hand that on last Monday morning a woman in FPlainfield was safely delivered of four girls at a???; one of whom died the night following the rest likely to do well. Saturday at a tavern near the market the following specimen of gormandising was??? ed :–A person not for any bet or without any other inducement than the craving of the stomacheat at one meal a shoulder of roast lamb 3 slices of bacon three quarters of a pound of cheese 15 large cucumbers one half of an 8d wheat loaf a plate of cold potatoes and drank a quarter of cider. 
   ID345,1790,NOOTKA SOUND. The circumstances of thetrade and situation of this part of North America being a matter of such general conversation and great public moment we are particularly happy in being enabled to give some further account of the transactions that have happened at Nootka Sounds as well as to point out the advantages that were likely to be extended to other places by the means of this trade. It is necessary to remark that the skin of the sea otter is worn only in the Northern regions of China. Its fur though beautiful and magnificent is too heavy for the sultry atmosphere of the Southern Provinces. Pekin is therefore the proper mart for this valuable commodity and in this immense city the consumption is so great that the produce of the voyage meets and immediate sale. The Mandarins of the Court and even the Emperor himself are fond of wearing this costly fur. To a citizen of common rank a sea otter's collar to his vestment is a luxury. The natives of the North West Coast of Ameerica set so great a value on woollens of all kinds that all the blankets cloths hats and stockings that could be procured in China if English manufacture were sold to the Indians with whose Chiefs treaties of commerce had been formed. An act of cruelty committed by an officer of the Spanish Admiral Martiney's ship deserves to be recorded. The Spaniards discovering that Callicum a Chief second in authority at Nootka Sound was in alliance with the English he was shot through the heart in the month of June 1789.?The wife of Callicum with an infant child escaped but not till wounded. Macquilla the Chief first in command retired at the head of the allies of England from Nootka Sound and to avoid the cruelty of the Spaniards they fled to distant parts. Such of the natives as they could seize the Spaniards condemned to work as slaves on their fortifications. At this period it was in the contemplation of the Spaniards to seize the Sandwich Islands with a view to deprive British ships of refreshments. And we further add on authority that amounts nearly to demonstration that on the very lands purchased from the Nootka Chief by Captain Mears the Spaniards have already opened valuable mines. Another object of this enterprise wasto supply the markets of Kamschatka and other ports belonging to the Russians with the teas and other produce of China. This promised to be an invaluable channel of commerce as the Chinese have shut their ports against the Russians who On this voyage of discovery and experiment one of our ships sailed and disposed of her cargo but was unfortunately lost on her return to China. To these curious particulars we add with a patriot joy that the consumption of the glorious staple of England her broad cloths is astonishingly great in Japan and China: British hard ware &c. is also in great request. From the friendship of Tiara to Captain Mears ships which touch at the Sandwich islands may depend on the utmost attention and civility. This Prince is six feet 4 1/2 inches high of proportionate bulk. 
   ID330,1791,New-York Oct. 11. We are informed that the census of Philadelphia is completed and that the city is found to contain fifty three thousand inhabitants. A Petersburgh (Virginia) paper of the 30th ult. informs the public of that state that a serious petition is now drawing up to be presented to the next congress stating arguments in favour of polygamy from the plain principles of reason; and praying that a man may legally marry two wives. This it is thought will be the most effectual means to extirpate the numerous race of old maids and increase the population of the United States. The petition is to be presented by a gentleman residing at Cabin Point. Oct 12. In one of the Charleston papers of the 16th ult. appears the epistle from the yearly meeting of the Quakers in London to the friends in Great Britain Ireland and America. It is remarkable that in the re-publication of this episstle in the Carolina paper the whole paragraph relative to theslave trade and negro slavery is omitted. Oct. 13. The ship Betsy Rook arrived on the 6th instant at Wilmington Delaware from Londonderry in Ireland. This vessel brought in a large number of Irish emigrants some of them people of property; who weary of the patronage of their old tutelar saint St. Patrick have come to settle themselves and their posterity in America under the more liberal auspices of St. Tammany. The following letter was written from a young heir to the Probate Judge–Sir–My father departed this life not long hence and has left a widow and five scorpions. I understand he died deetested and made me executioner but as the estate is like to prove insolent I was told that as you was Judge of reprobates you must send me a letter of condemnation. And as in duty bound ??? ??? pray &c. Extract of a letter from a gentleman in the county of Lincoln Massachusets dated Sept. 14. We have had a very wet season here since you went from us and the grass hoppers are innumerable; they have eat up all the gardens and all the grass; of course as the natural consequences we have no milk neither shall we have any beef or butter this season; the corn has also suffered very much from those insects Extract of a letter from Banbury (Georgia) Sept. 20 A firm peace being now to all appearance secured between the United States and the Creek Indians we may reasonable expect that the state of Georgia will soon begin to feel the good effects. The immediate beneficial consequences are already at this moment taking place. The vast tracts of fertile lands on both sides of the Altamahaw river are rapidly rising in value and nothing is wanting here (to compensate for the scarcity of slaves) but a hardy and industrious race of men who instead of being mere lookers on in quality of overseers and drivers would condescend to put their own hand to the axe or grubbing hoe and make this extensive territory one of the most desirable in the habitable world. The country round Sapola Sound and the mouth of Altamahaw is one of the most beautiful you can imagineabounding with everything that can make life comfortable besides an excellent navigation and easy bar at the north end of Sapola with rather more water than that of Charleston. Several vessels are hourly looked for from France (one in particular of 800 tons from Bourdeaux) to load with live oak ship timber and ??? in the river of St. Mary's. Extract of a letter from Hampton (Virginia) Sept. 25. There are two articles produced in the greatest abundance on different parts adjoining James river the exportations of which in the opinion of rational men ought to be considered as of the greatest importance to this state. These articles are coals and clays for the several colours of paint which may be had in any quantity and may be afforded at moderate prices. The mines of coal from every discovery we have been able to make are inexhaustible; all the samples however that you have yet seen are mere pickings up on the surface and there is reason to believe that the deeper we shall descend the better will be the quality of the coal. When once a company can be estblished with funds sufficient to take this matter in hand there is no doubt but that we can supply the different capital of the United States with coal equally good with that from Europe and at a much a more moderate price than that frequently brought. As to our paints there are none better in the world and in quantity when manufactured. Several gentlemen in the country up the river of property and enterprize are beginning to turn their attention to these branches; and with all submissions to our legislature it is thought that these two articles are by no means objects beneath their attention. Extract of a letter from Charleston Sept. 27. On Sunday last weas launched at Mr. Pri?chard's ship yard Hubcaw a fine new brig calculated to carry 700 barrels of rice the property of Mr. Hary Grant and is to be called the Pringle. A number of spectators collected from the city to view the pleasing sight with which they were no less delighted than with the liberal en tertainment and polite attention of Mr. O???. Boston Sept. 28. Yesterday sailed from this port the ship Columbia Capt. Robert Gray on a circum navigation voyage to the North-West coast of America.–This is the second voyage the Columbia has made to our coast–too much praise cannot be given to the gentlemen owners of the ship for their exertion in extending the commerce of America. The native of??? has returned to the place of its nativity. Dr. FRANKLIN Never declare yourself the author of a??? without being beyond doubt certain of??? was the Doctor's advice. He generally enforced his percepts by giving an example. I had been with a number of my acquaintance taking the diversion of a dance at an inn. The fiddler stepped out to get some refreshment. the tavern keeper came in and advised us in a very warm manner to make a collection for the fiddler who had been scraping his cat gut several hours in our service; we apparently agreed and he well pleased with the success of his persuasion went for his hat to collect what we were willing to give. We took up an old newspaper tore it into small pieces which we carefully folded and put into our pockets. The tavern keeper goes round the room and we very gravely drop our paper in his hat. The fiddler returns and the landlord with a cheerful face and an air of self approbation boasts of what he had been doing for him; It was I persuaded them to make the collection I made them give I went round to every one and see what I have got. If it had not been for me–the fiddler examines his prize and discovers the cheat–he vents all his anger upon the poor landlord's shoulders who thus suffered for proclaiming himself the author of a project before its success was fully ascertained. 
   ID349,1791,Norfolk April 11. This day arrived the ship Albion John Simmons master in 47 days from Rotterdam; on the 8th lying to in a heavy gale of wind the Albion shipped a sea which carried away all her boats and every loose article from the deck; there were three men of the watch one of whom is washed overboard and perished– his name is John M'Naught and belonged to Greenock. Extract of a letter from a gentleman at the falls of the Ohio to his relation inWinchester Virginia. dated April 13 1791. I wrote to you from Fort Pitt which place we left the 3d. inst. in company with two other boats and proceeded to Limestone without meeting or apprehending danger–at that place we were informed of several disasters which had befallen boats going down the river and one to a boat going up to a French station loaded with bacon butter &c. The particulars relative to the latter are as follow–The boat was attacked by about 60 or 70 Indians and the flankets that were on shore as a guard were fired on by them. –Immediately after firing they gave the Indian whoop and rushing on the flankets scalped them every one (about 22)– they then fired at the boat but did no damage as it required some time to make their way into the river. After the savages had executed this terrible act of barbarity they continued on the river watching for other boats. In the course of about six days five or six boats happened to come down the river–the savages attacked the foremost of them in which were two young ladies of the name Macdonald a young gentleman and some others passengers and took it. Elevated with this easy capture they imagined themselves capable of taking every boat they might fall in with–In a little time a second boat hove in fight which they attacked with great fury–they were in three canoes each canoe containing about twenty–they moved towards the boat as it came down and commenced firing; after discharging their guns they retreated loading and came on a second time fired and repeated nine different times; as often as they come on there was a brisk firing kept up from the boat which contained nine fighting men;– during the conflict two were killed and five wounded; two only remained to protect the boat and prevent the Indians from boarding it which every appearance of their conduct plainly indicated–These two brave fellows exerted themselves in a peculiar manner–on a near approach of the ??? they threw billets of wood at them and one of them took up an ax as a weapon of defence should they persist in boarding which the Indians perceiving and as is supposed their ammunition being expended they retreated without accomplishing their object. These inhuman monsters previous to their attacking the last mentioned boat placed the two young ladies in front of their canoes in which situation they were both killed. A few days after this transaction they fired at another boat and killed one young man. In short every boat tat has gone down the river lately has been fired at except our's. We saw no Indians; the places where the above depredation happened we passed in the night. Boston May 4. It is supposed that the adventures of the town of Boston lost 25000 dollars in the late lottery; besides 'wear and tear' of conscience. Salem May 31.

Colonel Jacob Webb and Captain Miller formerly of Stamford in Concecticut Mr. John Carmel of Philadelphia merchant and several other gentlemen with a negro boy were drowned on the 9th of March last in St. Mary's river (Georgia) occasioned by the oversetting of a boat in a sudden flaw of wind. Boston May 25. On Friday last the venerable Mr. John Simonds of Salem entered the one hundredth year of his age. He is the only male person who has arrived at that great age from the first settlement of the town by the English in 1629 to the present day. New York June 9. General Washington on his tour to the Southern Sates landed at Charlestown South Carolina in a barge decorated for the purpose with colours and pendants and rowed by twelve American Captains and a Cockswain all dressed in blue silk jackets black silk breeches white stockings and blue roses to their shoes. They had likewife hold laced hats; with silk bandeaus with the motto Long live the President. An immense number of people assembled near the Quay and on board the vessels in the river which as well as works saluted him with several discharges of artillery. The day was afterwards devoted to conviviality–The lodge of St. John addressed his Excellency as follows:– Right Worshipful Sir We the Master Officers and Members of St. John's Lodge No. 2 of Newbern beg leave to hail you welcome with three times three ! We approach you not with the language works have proved you to be the true and faithful Brother the skilful and expert Craftsmen the just and upright Man. But the powers of eloquence are too feeble to express with sufficient energy the cordial warmth with which our bosoms glow towards you–We therefore most frevently wish–more ardently and devoutly pray that the Providence of the Most High may strengthen establish and protect you in your walk through life–and when you are called off from your terrestrial labours by command of our divine grand master and your operations sealed with the mark of his approbation may your soul be everlastingly refreshed with the streams of living water which flow from the right hand of God. And when the Supreme Architect of all world's shall collect his most precious jewels as ornaments of the Celestial Jerusalem–may you eternally shine among those of the brightest lustre. To which the President returned the following answer:– Gentlemen I receive the cordial welcome which you are pleased to give me with sincere gratitude. My best ambition having aimed at the unbiassed approbation of my fellow citizens it is peculiarly pleasing to find my conduct so affectionately approved by a fraternity whose association is founded on justice and benevolence. In reciprocating the kind wishes contained in your address be persuaded that I offer a sincere prayer for your present and future happiness. George-Town. April 30. Yesterday morning about one or two o'clock the ship Termagant belonging to the house of Messrs. Claggen lying in the stream opposite this town was discovered on fire. The inhabitants of the town and the seamen in the harbour speedily collected but on account of a quantity of powder that was on board the efforts that otherwise would have been exerted to extinguish the flames were withholden. The first soon communicated itself to the powder; and the explosion was so severe as sensibly to shake mot of the houses in the town. The cinders and pieces of the ship were flying in every direction and it and it was with the greatest difficulty that in counting store and dwelling houses on the water side were prevented from sharing a similar fate with the ship. The extensive tobacco trade warehouse the property of Francis and Charles Loundes situated at some distance from the water wherein upwards of1000 hogsheads of tobacco were stored was several times in different places on fire ut happily extinguished without sustaining much damage. The loss occasioned by this alarming element must be great indeed as the ship was large and nearly new; besides there were goods to a considerable amount and a pretty large sum of money on board of her: all of which (excepting a part of the money which has since been found) was destroyed. We are informed that this accident proceeded from the steward's falling to sleep and leaving a candle burning in the cabbin which by some means or other set fire to the sails that were stowed there. It had got far advanced before it was discovered. Providentially no lives were lost. Pittsburgh May 21. A letter received in this town on Sunday last from Lieut. Jeffers at Fort Franklin mentions that an Indian had arrived there who brought him intelligence that 300 warriors of the Chippawa and other nations had set out for war and that they were determined to strike on the Allegheny or Ohio near Petersburgh; that 1000 men were preparing but their destination was not known. 
   ID89,1792,Longevity. –At Taconey a small village about seven miles from Philadelphia there is now living a shoemaker of the name of Robert Glen who in December last attained the great age of one hun - dred and fourteen years. Scotland was the place of his nativity; he remembers having seen King William III. and was present at the two succeeding coronations. Neither his memory nor his sight are in the least impaired; and such is his strength that after working all the week at his profession he regularly walks on Sunday to Philadelphia and back. His third wife is now living and is not more than thirty years old. 
   ID332,1792,Col. Alexander MacGillivray the celebrated Chief of the Creek Nations and an Ally of the United States died lately in the Creek territories. He passed most of his life in the remote parts of America. By his regulations the Indians have been very much civilized. His death has occasioned universal regret among his people. 
   ID354,1792,Extract of a letter from Luxene County. On Saturday the 1st of July I left Tioga point near the middle of the day; about half after one o'clock P. M. a shower appeared to be rising from the north west and I had scarcely time to take shelter in the house of Obadiah Gore Esq; at Sheshequen before the storm came on attended with heavy thunder and lightening and a violent gale of wind with rain. The storm continued up wards of half an hour during which time to see the tumbling of timber during the storm was surprising. After it abated I continued on my journey but found it very difficult travelling in many places the road being blocked up by the falling of timber. I reached Wilksbarree on Wednesday. It appears that the storm extended through the country and at the same hour of the day blew more violent in some places than others. At Exeeter about nine miles from Wilksbarrie a level plain loaded with pitch pine timber was swept of its timber; scarce a tree left for more than a mile in length and three fourths of a mile wide being either torn up by the roots or twisted off leaving their stumps from 5 to 30 feet high. A number of buildings in different parts of the country stript of their roofs and otherways damaged–fences in many place removed and many fields of corn others grain and flax laid level with the earth–cattle killed by the falling of timber in every part of the country. A Mr. –Lot who lived at Mahooper about 35 miles from Wilksbarre whose family consisted of his wife and a number of children– he with his wife being absent children seeing themselves in danger in the house left it at the instant a large tree was falling; the tree reached them a small distance from the door and a girl about eleven years of age was crushed to pieces about expired instantly. One of the other children had a thigh and both arms broke another badly wounded in the head–these two it is feared has received the fatal blow two other slightly wounded. Extract of a letter from Richmond Virginia dated July 28. By accounts from Kentucky we are informed that about the 1st of this month a party of Indians appeared near Frankfort and took a great number of horses and negroes. Col. M'Dowell with 300 men pursued them to the Ohio; but not falling in with them he crossed the river leaving 100 men to take care of his horses; after marching about 12 or 15 miles overtook a large party when a severe engagement ensued but being overpowered by numbers was obliged to retreat. He then sent for the men left behind and came up with the Indians the next day and after engaging some time obliged them to make a precipitate retreat. Col. M'Dowell took six Indian warriors two Englishmen and a Frenchman from Detroit and all the negroes and horses. Newtown June 27. On the 13th instant the meeting house in Newtown was removed about eight rods the removal was effected in one hour and an half after previous preparations for the purpose had been made. The house is between 70 and 80 feet long and about 50 feet wide with a steeple at one end; the whole of which was removed entire with the least injury to any part. 
   ID93,1793,Petersburgh May 10. There now resides in the neighbourhood of Prince Edward Court-house a person of the name Mr John Hollaway; this man was a soldier at taking Port Mabon Gibraltor and Vigo was 32 years of age at the coronation of Queen Anne in the year of the Duke of Marlborough and Duke of Ormond. He left England in the year 1714 the day after the coronation of George I. and arrived in Virginia a few weeks after that event. From these circumstances he is at this time 124 years of age appears to enjoy good spirits and sings a song with strength of voice and distinct [??]culation. This man's life also furnishes an extraordinary ???; at the age of 67 he married a person aged [??] by whom he had issue a son now alive aged [??] and where the father now lives. 
   ID97,1794,The laws of the State of Pennsylvania and that of Massachusetts by which the punishment of death is abolished in all cases except for wilful murder are about to be adopted by the respective Legislatures of all the other States. The system of the great and merciful???caria has taken place of the sanguinary Penal laws of England. The abolition ofNegro slavery which has taken shape in the five New England States of New Hampshire Massachusets Rhode island Connecticut and Vermont; in the Midland States of New York New Jersey Pennsylvania and Delawar; and in the Western State of Kentucky for several years past is now extended by act of Congress to the Southern States of Virginia North Carolina South Carolina Georgia and Maryland; and the emancipation of the remainder of that unfortunate race of men is to take place on or before the fifth of November 1795. The Legislature of the State of Massachusetts has g???ed a part of the public lands to the emancipated Negroes of that State in proportion to the numbers of the respective families where the liberal and philanthropic mind is gratified by seeing them erect villages cultivate farms and form communities of civilized Societies. Before the Gentleman who has favoured us with this Intelligence left America they had established a Lodge of Masonry; and he had the satisfaction of seeing them on a grand day parade to Church in all the magnificence of the Order where a sermon was preached on the occasion by one of their own colour. They have also endowed public schools employed??? and erected places of Public Worship. The Officers Non-commissioned Officers and Soldiers who served in the Continental army and established the Liberty of their Country have at last received a reward infinitely beyond their expectations but every way corresponding with the liberty of a great and rising Republic. Five hundred acres of land have been voted by Congress this last Session to each individual who served throughout the war; and to the defendants of those who fell in contending for the Rights of Nature and eequal proportion to those who served for a shorter period; and to prevent its being sold at a price under its real value to the injury of the Patriotic Veteran as has been the case of former grants he is allowed his option of taking its value in sterling money at the present market price from the Treasure of the States; or any part in land and the rest in moneya s may be most agreeable to the receiver. The Mint of the United States which was established two years since has begun to issue its hold and silver coin: the copper has been delivered some time. The gold coins are eagles half eagles and quarter eagles. The first is exactly five and forty shillings English money or ten American coin. The dollars are coined in the same divisions of half and quater which makes the courie of exchange simple and suits the reckoning to a very capacity–as our Readers will perceive that ten quarter dollars make the quarter eagle; ten half dollars the half eagle; and ten dollars the eagle. There is besides one more silver coin which is called a Dime and is the tenth part of a dollar. The copper coin is called a Cent and is the tenth part of a Dime. Six of the ships of war which were voted by Congress in November last are completed and put in commission: the remaining twenty four will be ready by Midsummer next and will complete a fleet of ??? hundred guns. The city of Washington which in five years more will be the Capital of the United States will in every respect be the first in the world: the Capitol or Congress House is situated upon a beautiful eminence and c??? a full and complete view of every part of the city as well as a considerable extent of the country around. The President's house likewise stands upon a rising ground near the banks of the Potamac possessing a delightful water prospect together with a commanding view of the Capitol and some other material parts of the city. From the President's house to the Capitol run two great pleasure parks or malls which intersect and terminate upon the banks of the Potomac and are ornamented at the sides by elegant buildings for Foreign Ministers. The four fronts of the Capitol as well as those of the President's house are of the finest marble. The building of these superb edifices has been much retarded by the want of stone cutters masons bricklayers carpenters and blacksmiths who at this time actually receive the enormous wages of ten shillings American currency per day. The district of Country at the back of North Carolina reaching to the Mississippi and covering a country six hundred miles long by three hundred broad is next winter to be formed into a Sixteenth State; and the Province of Maine extending from the borders of New Hampshire to the river St. Croix is expected to form a Seventeenth. The new cities build in America since her independence are Grenville in the State of Georgia; Martenberg the Capitol of North Carolina; Columbia the Capital of South Carolina; Noxville and Nashville in the Tenesee Settlements; Danville Fairfield and Lex ington in the State of Kentucky; Washington the Capital of the United States; Sunbury in the State of Pennsylvania; Hudson upon Husdon's River and Cooper's Town in the State of New York; Bennington in the State of Vermont; and Paterson in the State of New Jersey. All the towns burnt by the English in the was have been rebuilt and the old cities of Charlestown Baltimore Philadelphia New York and Boston have been extended to more than double the extent they had before the peace. The population of the United States by the last Census in 1790 was more than double what it was in 1775 by which it appears that America doubles her number of people every fifteen years. The emigrations from the different nations in Europe to that country are esimated at one hundred and sixty thousand annually. The increase of farms and villages has been so great as to people four new States and to extend their Settlements from the Atlantic to the Ohio in the South and from the Atlantic to the Lakes on the River St. Lawrence in the North. 
   ID121,1817,Emigration to America. [ Extracted from No.15 of Cobbet's Register published on Saturday 12th instant ]. Cobbett's arrival in America&c. On Wednesday evening the 27th March we embarked on board the Importer D. Ogden master bound to New York where we arrived on the 5th of May with about 40 steerage passengers farmers and tradesmen who were fleeing from ruin and starvation. In all respects that can be named our passage disagreeable and upon one occasion very perilous from lightning which struck the ship twice shivered two of the masts killed a man struck several people slightly between two of whom I was sitting without at all feeling the blow. Some of our fellow-passengers have found great disappointment ; and it is stated in some of the public papers here that many hundreds have during the last year accepted of the offer of our Consul at New York to go and settle in Canada. You know that I have never advised any body to emigrate. I have always said that it is no place for manufacturers ; no place for men to live without work ; no place for a farmer who does not work himself ; no place in short for any one who is not able and willing to work at the ordinary sorts of work ; but for such men there is every where a plentiful happy and easy life. None should come however who have any views of idleness ; and even for the industrious poor I see no reason why they should expend their last shilling and undergo all the miseries and dangers of a sea voyage in order to save those who eat the taxes the expence of their share of poor-rates ; a man and his wife and a child or two cannot come under the expence of 35 guineas at least. A single man 20 guineas before he gets into work again ; and as I always said I never would if I were in the place of such a man expend my earnings on a sea voyage and endure all its hardships in order to remove one eye sore out of the way of corruption. Besides there is the climate which is not so good as ours though it is not bad and people often live to an old age. The country is good but it will easily be conceived that new face an entire new scene a separation from every friend work done in a quite different way from it is in England ; it will easily be conceived that all this makes such a dislocation in a man's mind as to make him very unhappy for a while. Then he cannot expect to find work the first day. He must ask first at any rate. Englishmen are sheepish ; and they are sure to find rascals enough here to foster their disgust merely for the sake of serving the cause of corruption at home. In short I advice nobody to emigrate but I will truly describe the country and the people. As to emigrating with a view of settling and farming in the new countries it is neither more nor less than downright madness. It is what our English farmers know nothing at all about ; it is what they are not at all fit for ; and the far greater part of all such spe culations end in disappointment if not in ruin and premature death. I hope that our beloved country will shortly be fit for an honest and industrious man to live in ; but if any farmers come with money in their pockets my advice is not to give way either to enthusiastic admiration or to instant disgust. But to stop a little ; to look about them ; to see not only after good land but a good market for its products. The western romance writers tell us that the land in the Ohio is too good ; but Mr Mellish in his valuable book tells us that beef and pork sell for three halfpence a pound. An excellent country for people who want to do nothing but eat. – Give me Long Island where the land is not too good ; but where beef and pork sell for about eightpence a pound (I speak of English money); where good hay sells for five pounts a ton ; and where there is a ready market for every species of produce. One thing above all ; if an English farmer (I mean by English people of the whole of the United Kingdom) comes here with money in his pocket let him resolve to keep it there for a year and then he will be sure to do well. – All that I see around me here is well calculated to attract the attention and to please the sight of one like myself brought up in the country always greatly delighted with and somewhat skilled in various pleasing and healthful pursuits. The The people are engaged busily in planting their Indian corn. The cherry trees of which there are multitudes planted in long avenues or rows or round the fields have dropped their blossom and begin to show their loads of fruit. The apple and pear orchards in extent from one to twenty acres on each farm are in full and beautiful bloom. The farms are small in extent ; no appearance of want amongst the labourers who receive in the country about two shillings and threepence (our money) a-day with board and lodging and which board consists of plenty of excellent meat and fish of all sorts the best of bread butter cheese and eggs. That you may form some idea as to prices of living I will state a few facts which have already come within my own knowledge. We are at present at an inn thirteen miles from New York. It is on the road to that city. Scarcely an hour in the day passes without a carriage of some sort offering for going thither and to go by the regular stage costs three shillings. Mind I shall always speak in English money when I do not speak of dollars. We lodge and board in this inn have each a bed-room and good bed have a room to sit in ourselves ; we eat by ourselves ; and it really is eating. – We have smoked fish chops butter and eggs for breakfast with bread (the very finest I ever sa) crackers sweet cakes ; and when I say that we have such and such things I do not mean that we get them for show or just enough to smell to ; but in loads. Not an egg but a dish full of eggs. Not a snip of meat or of fish ; but a plateful. Lump sugar for our tea and coffee ; not broke into little bits the size of a hazle nut but in good thumping pieces. For dinner we have the finest of fish bass mackerel lobsters ; of meat lamb veal ham &c. ; asparagus in plenty ; apple pieces (through in the middle of May). The supper is like the breakfast with preserved peaches and other things. And with all this an excellent cyder to drink with the kindest and most obliging treatment on the part of the landlord and landlady and their sons and daughters we pay no more than 22s. 6d. a week each. In England the same food and drink and lodging at an inn would cost us nearly the same sum every day. But there are two things which no money can purchase any where. The first is no grumbling on the part of the landlady except on account of our eating and drinking too little ; and the other is that Mr Wiggins has no fastening but a bit of chip run in over the latch of the door to a house which is full of valuable things of all sorts and about which we leave all our things much more carelessly than we should do in our own house in any part of England. Here then are we able to live at an inn one of the most respectable in the whole country at the rate of fifty pounds a year while the pay of a common farming man is not much short of that sum. 
   ID357,1817,ANOTHER DREADFUL MASSACRE BY THE NATIVES OF THE MARQUESAS ISLANDS. (From the Sydney Gazette Nov. 8. 1815) By the Governor Macquarrie are arrived Captain Fowler and part of the crew of the Indian brig Matilda which sailed from this colony in August 1813 bound on a voyage to the Derwent and Eastern Islands and from thence to China but was cut off and plundered on the night of the 10th of April last while lying at anchor in Duff's Bay at the Island of Rooapoah one of the Marquesas on a sandal-wood voyage. Five of the crew (Poomootoo men) had previously deserted and joining with some of the Rooapoah natives took the opportunity of a dark night and the wind blowing fresh right on the land to cut the vessel adrift by which means she drove on shore through a heavy surf and was soon bilged and filled with water. When the cannibal natives saw that it was impracticable to get the vessel afloat they concurred universally in the design of putting the whole of her crew to death; which appears to have been a constant practise among the different natives towards one another when their canoes happen to fall upon a strange shore through stress of weather or from any other accident. Captain Fowler had formed an intimacy with their chief or king Nooahetu who presided at the horrible tribunal that had devoted the unfortunate mariners to instant slaughter. He withheld his assent to the murder; but had no hesitation in permitting the plunder of the vessel– The crew were informed by such expressions as they could understand as well as by gesticulations that accompanied their vehement debate on the occasion that their lives were dependent on the issue; the good chief was opposed to many other chiefs who though somewhat inferior in rank were very far superior in number supported by the common usages of the island from which the exhibition of clemency appeared an insufferable deviation. He was seated with his son by his side on a mat in his own dwelling; he had been called to the supremacy of the island by the general wish of the people as it was not a hereditary right but an elective dignity. His people pressed their solicitations earnestly and at length peremptorily demanded his assent to the sacrifice; which he for a length of time opposed by the force of words which not seeming likely to prevail he adopted a method which silenced the whole in an instant and saved the lives of Capt. Fowler and his crew. Finding that all his expostulations were defeated on the principle of undeviating custom he deliberately took up two ropes that were near him and fixing one round the neck of his son and the other round his own called to the chief next in command who immediately approached him. His conference was short and decisive: he first pointed to the cord that encircled the neck of his son and then to the other which he had entwined around his own. These strangers are doomed to death said he by my chiefs and my people: and it is not fit that I who am their King should live to see so vile a deed perpetrated. Let my child and myself be strangled before it is performed and then it never will be said that we sanctioned even with our eye-sight the destruction of these unoffending people. The magnanimity of such a conduct could not do less than produce even in the mind of the unenlightened savage a paroxysm of surprise mingled with a sentiment of admiration in which the untaught man may possibly excel his fellow - creature whose conceptions are moulded by tenets calculated to guard him from the extremes of passion. For a moment the people looked wildly upon their king whose person they adored because that his principles were good and his government just and mild. They saw the obedient chief to whom the order of strangulation had been imparted staring with horror and amazement at the change which a few moments had produced; The mandate which had proceeded from the King's own lips must be obeyed; and commanded to perform the dreadful office he proceeded to obey when a sudden shout from the multitude awed him to forbearance. The King! the King! from every lip burst forth–'What! kill the King! No no let all the strangers live–no man shall kill the King! Thus were their lives preserved and the vessel plundered of every thing on board her. The floor of the Greenwich which was burnt at Noorheva still remains and is dry at low water. All her iron and copper have been taken out by the natives who have a thorough know ledge of the use of these materials. That they are cannibals is well ascertained. They form distinct factions and make war upon the ruling chief. The rebels are denominated the typees; and the opposite parties are horribly sanguinary towards each other. Six of the adverse party were killed and devoured by the rebels while Captain Fowler was among them and the following de testable circumstance occurred on the occasion: A native man belonging to Port Anna Maria who was not tattooed and in consequence prohibited from the eating of human flesh on pain of death impatient of the restraint fell upon one of the murdered bodies and darting his teeth into it in all the madness of a voracious fury exhaled the crimson moisture which had not yet coagulated. The chief of Port Anna Maria who is very friendly to Europeans is named Ke-atta-nooe the first part of the name implying the outrigger of a canoe and the latter signifying great. The dress of the men consists merely of a wrapper about the waist; the women are covered from the shoulders downwards to the ancles and are generally fairer than the Taheitan women. The chiefs have no distinguishing mark or ornament but in the mode of wearing their hair; which the common orders wear tied up in a large knot on each side of the head a stripe of which extending from the forehead to the hollow of the neck is kept shorn which practice the chiefs do not adopt. Captain Fowler supposes the worms to be more prevalent and destructive to the ship's bottoms there than he has any where else witnessed; and to this cause attributes the caution of the natives in drawing up their largest canoes some of which contain from 80 to 100 warriors. They are anxious after every kind of property carried among them for barter and this is supposed their chief inducement for attacking vessels when they can do so with a probability of accomplishing their object.– They have no knowledge of the use of muskets and have none among them except a few at Port Anna Maria. A gentleman at this time in Sydney who resided among them about fifteen years ago in a Missionary capacity describes them as a people constantly employing their thoughts on plunder and devising schemes for taking advantage of strangers. Their population is very numerous; which he remarked to some of them to whom he gave a description of Otaheite observing at the same time that its in habitants were less numerous:– Can't we go and take them?- What is there to hinder us? was immediately demanded. This anecdote we notice as a specimen of their natural inclination to hostility in which all accounts respecting them correspond.

   ID361,1817,ANOTHER DREADFUL MASSACRE BY THE NATIVES OF THE MAR QUESAS ISLANDS. [From the Sydney Gazette November 8 1815.] By the Governor Macquarrie are arrived Captain Fowler and part of the crew of the India brig Matilda which sailed from this colony in August 1813 bound on a voyage to the Derwent and Eastern Islands and from thence to China; but was cut off and plundered on the night of the 10th of April last while lying at anchor in Duff's Bay at the Island of Rooapoah one of the Marquesas on a sandal-wood voyage. Five of the crew (Poomootoo men) had previously deserted and joining with some of the Rooapoah natives took the opportunity of a dark night and the wind blowing fresh right on the land to cut the vessel adrift; by which means she drove ashore through a heavy surf and was soon bilged and filled with water. When the cannibal natives saw that it was impracticable to get the vessel afloat they concurred universally in the design of putting the whole of her crew to death; which appears to have been a constant practise among the different natives towards one another when their canoes happen to fall upon a strange shore through stress of weather or from any other accident. Captain Fowler had formed an intimacy with their Chief or King Nooahetu who presided at the horrible tribunal that had devoted the unfortunate mariners to instant slaughter. He withheld his assent to the murder; but had no hesitation in permitting the plunder of the vessel. The crew were informed by such expressions as they could understand as well as by gesticulations that accompanied their vehement debate on the occasion that their lives were dependent on the issue; the good Chief was opposed by many other Chiefs who though somewhat inferior in rank were very far superior in number supported by the common usages of the island from which the exhibition of clemency appeared an insufferable deviation. He was seated with his son by his side on a mat in his own dwelling: he had been called to the supremacy of the island by the general wish of the people as it was not a hereditary right but an elective dignity. His people pressed their solicitations earnestly and at length peremptorily demanded his assent to the sacrifice; which he for a length of time opposed by the force of words which not seeming likely to prevail he adopted a method which silenced the whole in an instant and saved the lives of Captain Fowler and his crew. Finding that all his expostulations were defeated upon the principle of undeviating custom he deliberately took up two ropes that were near him and fixing one round the neck of his son and the other round his own called to the Chief next in command who immediately approached him. His conference was short and decisive; he first pointed to the cord that encircled the neck of his son and then to the other which he had entwined around his own. These strangers are doomed to death said he by my chiefs and my people and it is not fit that I who am their King should live to see so vile a deed perpetrated. Let my child and myself be strangled before it is performed; and then it never will be said that we sanctioned even with our eye - sight the destruction of these unoffending people. The magnanimity of such a conduct could not do less than produce even in the mind of the unenlightened savage a paroxysm of surprise mingled with a sentiment of admiration in which the untaught man may possibly excel his fellow creature whose conceptions are moulded by tenets calculated to guard him from the extremes of passion. For a moment the people looked wildly upon their King whose person they adored because that his principles were good and his government just and mild. They saw the obedient chief to whom the order of strangulation had been imparted staring with horror and amazement at the change which a few moments had produced; the mandate that had proceeded from the King's own lips must be obeyed;and commanded to perform the dreadful office he proceeded to obey–when a sudden shout from the multitude awed him to forbearance. The King! the King! from every lip burst forth:– What! kill the King! No no let all the strangers live –no man shall kill the King! Thus were their lives preserved and the vessel plundered of every thing on board her. The floor of the Greenwich which was burnt at Nooaheva still remains and is dry at low water. All her iron and copper have been taken out by the natives who have a thorough knowledge of the use of these materials. That they are cannibals is well ascertained. They form distinct factions and make war upon the ruling Chief; the rebels are denominated the Typees; and the opposing parties are horribly sanguinary towards each. Six of the adverse party were killed and devoured by the rebels while Captain Fowler was among them and the following detestable circumstance occurred on the occasion:–A native man belonging to Port Anna Maria who was not tattooed and in consequence prohibited from the eating of human flesh on pain of death impatient of the restraint fell upon one of the murdered bodies and darting his teeth into it in all the madness of a voracious fury exhaled the crimson moisture which had not yet coagulated. The Chief of Port Anna Maria who is very friendly to Europeans is named Ke-atta-nooe the first part of the name implying the outrigger of a canoe and the latter signifying great. The dress of the men consists merely of a wrapper about the waist; the women are covered from the shoulders downwards to the ancles and are generally fairer than the Taheitan women.

   ID159,1820,Dutch Colonial Law and Negro Fortitude. (From Lavaysse's Account of Venezuela Trinidad Margaritta and Tobago just published.) Stedman after having given a picture of the cruelties practised on the negroes at Surinam relates that on his arrival in that colony a white man was flagged by a black executioner for having stolen some money from the townhouse ; and he remarked that this negro inflicted the punishment with great signs of commiseration. A negro was broken on the wheel for the same crime and he bore that horrible punishment without a sigh. A moment afterwards they prepared to hang another and whilst the hangman was tying the cord round his neck to launch him into eternity he looked steadfastly with a smile of contempt at his judges who were among the spectators of the execution. Having expressed to the persons who were near me (says Captain Stedman) how much I was shocked with the injustice and cruelty of those executions and surprised at the intrepidity of the negroes during the punishment a very decent looking man thus addressed me ; Sir you are newly arrived from Europe ; but if you were better acquainted with negro slaves what you now see would neither excite your surprise nor your pity. It is not long since I saw a negro suspended from that very gibbet by the ribs. The following is the manner in which it was done : two incisions were made in his side in which was passed an iron hook attached to a chain. He lived three days suspended in that manner his head and feet hanging down licking from his bleeding breast the drops of water that fell on it for it rained at the time. The sufferer did not however utter a groan and never once complained. On the third day another negro was flogged under the gallows and having cried from pain the former reproached him for his want of courage: Are you a man? said he to him you behave like a child! – A moment afterwards the soldier who was sentry on the spot taking pity on him dashed out his brains with the butt end of his musquet. I saw another negro quartered the narrator: After his arms and legs were tied to four very strong horses an iron nail was driven under each nail of his hands and feet He suffered that without complaining requested a glass of ru and ordered the executioners to let loose the horses. But that which amused us most continued this monster was the humour of the fellow who when the hangman presented the glass of rum to him that he had asked for told him to drink first as he was very much afraid of bepoisoned and desired him to take care that his horses should not kick him. As for old negroes being broken on the wheel and young women burnt alive nothing is more common in this colony! 
   ID207,1828,Love in a Prison. –We have all heard that Love rules the court the camp the grove but we have rarely heard that the little god delighted to dwell in prisoned solitude ; true it is and of verity nevertheless that he seems if not to have fixed his dwelling in at least to be a very constant visitor of our jail. It is not long since a couple who had imbided the tender passion were linked in the bonds of matrimony in it ; and a like consumnation most devoutly to be wished for by another pair of inmates would ere now have taken place did not envious bolts and bars intervene for a petition has been presented by two delinquents of different sexes both under sentence of transportation to the Magistrates praying that they may be allowed to marry before setting out for New South Wales. The fond pair never saw each other till inclosed in the same vehicle on their way to stand trial at last Perth Circuit for capital offences ; yet in this situation love–omnipotent love–took the captives captive and rendered them in its enjoyment even in their perilous plight o'er a' the ills o' life victorious. But alas! the course of true love never did run smooth; and no less a personage than the Secretary of State for the Home Department has in this case crossed the path of the hapless couple and doomed them to single blessedness for many a year by ordering the fair penitent to be removed to Penitentiary at Millbank for seven years instead of transportation for fourteen ; leaving the forlorn lover to seek consolation in the charms of some sterling or currency damsel in the land of promise to which he must now wend his solitary way.– Fife Hld.

   ID286,1839,Selected Poetry The Woodland By the Late Robert Nicoll. The woodland wild ! – wilt thou go with me Where the squirrel is perchen on his oaken tree– where the yellow fern doth wave its head– Where the hands of night the dew hath laid– And the winds that wander to and fro Kiss the brown leaflets as they go– Where the morning sun peeps in so mild To the dark green nooks of the woodland wild ? The woodland wild ! –where the dun deer roam And the song-birds build them a happy home– Where the grass is green and the turf so sweet Seems shorn by the tread of fairy feet– Where the daylight comes so richly dim And the cushat's coo seems a hermit's hymn The care-worn heart might be self-beguiled To forget its woes in the woodland wild ! The woodland wild ! –where the hazels grow Where the ladye-broom doth its branches throw– Where the God-built sky is in patches seen Through the roof of leaves. There aye hath been The home of those wild and fairy flowers That gladden all Nature's life and ours As they bloom by the stream–that prattling child That wanders along through the woodland wild ! The woodland wild !–If thy heart be pure If thy faith in the right be firm and sure Go wander the woodlands parth within And the love of Nature woo and win; Drink of the cup of beauty there Where the breath of Omnipotence scents the air; For the Father of beauty in love hath smiled On the sweet green bowers of the woodland wild The woodlan wild !–long long ago I have buried myself its leaves below And dreamed of its beauteous tenants all– 'Tis the linnet's home and fairies' hall! 'Tis the spot where the wondrous monk of old His hermitage reared in the pleasant wold; By its door a crystal springlet boiled For the pilgrim to drink in the woodlan wild! The woodland wild !–what pleasant stories Make sunlight over its olden glories– Of Robin Hood and his bowmen bold The raids they made and the tales they told ! In winter in spring and in summer time The glorious forests are aye in prime ; For glad thoughts forever are round them piled Those grassy glades in the woodland wild! The woodland wild!–make haste.–make haste! Away with me and its gladness taste; We will wander beside each gushing stream Where flowers in the water reflected gleam; We will follow its paths and pluck its flowers And lie on its grass in the evening hours Till the dying sunlight soft and mild Warns us away from the woodland wild ! Tail's Magazine Song of the Emigrants to New Zealand Steer helmsman till you steer our way By stars beyond the line– We go to found a realm–one day– Like England's self to shine. Chorus. Cheer up ! Cheer up! our course we'll keep With dauntless heart and hand And when we've ploughed the stormy deep We'll plough a smiling land. A land whose beauties importune The Briton to its bowers To sow but plenty's seeds and prune Luxuriant fruits and flowers Chorus –Cheer up ! cheer up ! There tracts uncheered[?] by human words Seclusion's wildest holds Shall hear the lowing of our herds The tinkling of our folds Chorus –Cheer up ! cheer up ! Like rubies set in gold shall blush Our vineyards girt with corn And wine and oil and gladness gush From Amalthea's horn. Chorus –Cheer up ! cheer up ! Britannia's pride is in our hearts Her blood is in our veins We'll girdle earth with British arts Like Ariel's magic chains Chorus. Cheer up ! cheer up ! our course we'll keep With dauntless heart and hand And when we've ploughed the stormy deep We'll plough a smiling land. T. Campbell London 16th August 1839. 
   ID289,1839,Afflicting Case of Destitution. –Some time ago a vessel was advertised to sail from this port for Australia and to take out Government settlers free of expense. A family in Shetland consisting of the husband wife and six of a young family sold off their effects and came to Leith for the purpose of availing themselves of this opportunity to settle in the above colony. On applying to the agent however they were informed that they did not come under the description of persons wanted. Since therefore they have lived in Leith till their little all has been exhausted and the husband from the combined effects of disappointment and want has been thrown upon a sick-bed and the whole family are literally in a state of starvation. Several private individuals with a benevolence that does them the highest credit have temporarily supplied their wants ; but the hands of private charity is soon crippled and unless something else be immediately done we may have soon to report one or more of their deaths from the actual want of the necessaries of life. The object of the present notice therefore is to draw forth the sympathies of the charitable to relive a family thus suddenly involved in want and misery who from their industrious habits and every way excellent characters left their native home with the good wishes of all their friends. Any donations either in money or clothes will be thankfully received by Mr Andrew Spence of the firm of Messrs Cunninham & Spence No. 62 Tolbooth-wynd Leith. 
   ID293,1840,Literature Narrative of a Whaling Voyage Round The Globe &c. &c By Frederick Debell Bennett Esq. F.R.G.S. 2 vols. London: Richard Bentley. We have been somewhat disappointed in these volumes. We expected to have found them like Scoresby's full of interesting details regarding whale fishing whereas there is hardly a word on the subject throughout the whole of the first volume and very little in the second ; in fact what there is is confined to a sort of supplementary appendix. This is the more strange that one of the chief purposes of the author as he himself informs us in undertaking this voyage was to investigate the anatomy and habits of southern whales and the mode of conducting the sperm whale fishery subjects which he remarks were then untouched by the literature of any country. Yet in the work itself this chief purpose dwindles into one of very secondary prominence. This the readers of the work at least most of them will the more regret on finding how very curious and interesting are the two or three chapters which the author has given on the subject of South Sea whaling. There are full of entertaining details of both a popular and scientific character and cannot be read without exciting a wish that larger portion of the work had been composed of such material. In making these remarks however we are far from intending to depreciate the sort of information in the shape chiefly of sketches of the South Sea Islands to which the greater part of the volumes are devoted ; we mean merely to say that it is not what we expected from the title of the work nor we may add what for our own reading we should have preferred. Yet are these sketches very amusing reading–full of graphic descriptions and curious details of native character which is still found in the South Sea Islands in a state of very primitive simplicity. We have frequently seen says Mr Bennett amongst the congregagation assembled at Church (in Raiatea) a native clothed in nothing but a shirt ; another with a beaver hat surmounting a person naked except the scanty maro ; and a third whose whole attire was a black coat white neckerchief and a shirt! We observe a rather odd circumstance noted by Mr Bennett. He says that the temperate ships of America are the principal purveyors of ardent spirits to the natives of the South Sea Islands carrying large quantities of rum thither for the purposes of traffic! This is placing the temperance principle in a somewhat curious predicament. Another remark of the author's not less striking–mark it well and take comfort from it ye bon vivants[?] of the civilzed world–is that disease is as abundant amongst the native islanders as amongst the most refined of their species and from this concludes that man in his savage state is as liable to the ills that flesh is heir to as in his civilised condition. Dr Johnson made a similar remark regarding the Highlanders of Scotland ; alleging that the London alderman lived as long over his turtle feast as the Highlander over his paten cake. What degree of fellow-feeling with civic dignitary and his good living or whether any dictated this remark of the learned doctor we cannot say. Mr Bennett's work is written with great ability and in style whose only fault is exhibited in a tendency occasionally to the use of rather learned phraseology. We conclude with an extract from that portion of the work which from its great interest we regretted was not larger but which limited as it is is so full of curious information and so crowded with remarkable incident as to render the selection by no means an easy task. Some sperm whales appear reluctant to employ their tail when attacked but prove active and dangerous with their jaws. Such individuals often rather seek than avoid the attacking boats and rushing upon them with open mouth employ every possible art to crush them with their teeth and if successful will sometimes continue in their neighbourhood biting the wreck and oars into small fragments. When thus threatening a boat the whale usually turns and swings upon its back and will sometimes act in a very sluggish and unaccountable manner keeping its formidable lower jaw suspended for some moments over the boat in a threatening attitude but ultimately rolling to one side and closing its mouth harmlessly ; nor is it rare to observe this whale when pursued and attacked retain[?] its mouth in an expanded state for some minutes together. Such threatening demonstrations of the jaw as well as some others with the flukes occasionally compel a boat's crew to leap into the water and support themselves by swimming or clinging to oars until the danger has passed. In the year 1835 the ship Pusie Hall encountered a fighting whale which after injuring and driving off her four boats pursued them to the ship and withstood for some time the lances hurled at it by the crew from the bows of the vessel before in could be induced to retire ; in this affair a youth in one of the boats was destroyed by a blow from the whale and one of the officers was severely lacerated by coming in contact with the animal's jaw. A highly tragical instances of the power and ferocity occasionally displayed by the sperm whale is recorded in the fate of the American South-Seaman Essex Captain G. Pollard. This vessel when cruising in the Pacific Ocean in the year 1820 was wrecked by a whale under the following extraordinary circumstances. The boats had been lowered in pursuit of a school of whales and the ship was attending them to windward. The master and second mate were engaged with whales they had harpooned in the midst of the school and the chief mate had returned on board to equip a spare boat in lieu of his own which had been broken and rendered unserviceable. While the crew were thus occupied the look-out at the masthead reported that a large whale was coming rapidly down upon the ship the mate hastened his task in the hope that he might be ready in time to attack it. The Cachalot which was of the largest size consequently a male and probably the guardian of the school in the meanwhile approached the ship so closely that the although the helm was put up to avoid the contact he struck her a severe blow which broke off a portion of her keel. The enraged animal was then observed to retire to some distance and again rush upon the ship with extreme velocity. His enormous head struck the starboard bow beating in a corresponding portion of the planks and the people on board had barely time to take to their boats before the ship filled with water and fell over on her side. She did not sink however for some hours ; and the crew in the boats continued near the wreck until they had obtained a small supply of provisions when they shaped a course for land ; but here it is to be regretted they made a fatal error. At the time the accident happened they were cruising on the Equator in the longitude of about 118[?] degrees West with the Marquesan and Society Islands on their lee and might have sailed in their boats to either of those groups in a comparatively short time. Under an erroneous impression however that all those lands were inhabited by an inhospitable race of people they preferred pulling to windward for the coast of Peru and in the attempt were exposed for a lengthened period in extreme privations. A few Cachalots have been noted individually as animals dangerous to attack. One was thus distinguished on the cruising ground off the coast of New Zealand and was long know to whalers by the name of 'New Zealand Tom.' He is said to have been of great size conspicuously distinguished by a white hump ; and famous for the havoc he had made amongst the boats and gear of ships attempting his destruction. A second example of cimilar celebrity was known to whalers in the Straits of Timor. He had so often succeeded in repelling the attacks of his foes as to be considered invincible but was at length despatched by a whaler who forewarned of his combative temper adopted the expedient of floating a cask on the sea to withdraw his attention from the boats ; but notwithstanding this ruse the animal was not destroyed without much hard fighting nor until the bow of one of the boats had been nipped off by his jaws. 
   ID313,1842,A ustralian Trust Company Incorporated by Royal Charter No. 48 Moorgate Street London. Capital t100000 in 10000 shares of t100 each with power to increase the capital to t2000000. Directors. Chairman– John Abel Smith Esq. M.P. Levi Ames Esq. . Robert How Esq. Henry Bainbridge . Esq. John Innes Esq. Thomas Byron jun. Esq. . Francis Mowatt Esq. Benjamin Green Esq. . Charles John Pearse Esq. William Hart Esq. . Hastings Elwin Esq. Langford Hovell Hodge . now in Australia Esq. Auditors. Right Hon. The Lord . Sir Edward Parry R.N. Mayor. . Nassau William Senior Abel Lewis Gower Esq. . Esq. Bankers–Messrs Smith Payne & Smiths. Solicitors–Messrs James Charles & H. Freshfield. Colonial Board in Sydney. Chairman– Hastings Elwin Esq. who was Deputy Chairman of the Court of Directors. Alexander Macleay Esq. . Richard Jones Esq. Thomas Barker Esq. . John Lamb Esq. To be joined by Thomas Icely Esq. who was a Director here and who is on his way to Sydney. Solicitor–James Norton Esq. The Company was established and incorporated (and is now in full operation) to carry out in Australia a principle which has been acted on with great success elsewhere namely that of taking up money in this country at a moderate rate of interest on the credit of a large invested capital and laying it out on undoubted freehold security at a higher rate. The Company is now prepared to grant transferable notes under the Corporation seal to persons desirous of advancing Money to the Company on loan. The notes will be for t100 each or any larger sum desired by the lender and will be made payable at any period which may be agreed upon not being shorter than two years. The notes will bear interest at the rate of five per cent per annum payable half-yearly (on the 15th January and 15th July) on the production of the half-yearly vouchers which will be annexed to each note: these vouchers or coupons will render it unnecessary for the holder of a note to present the note itself until the principal becomes due. The form of note has been preferred to that of bond as admitting of transfer without expense or trouble whilst it affords equal security to the holder. The Colonial Board has been established in Sydney and the operation of the Company are at present confined to New South Wales. Security being the first object of the Company all the arrangements have been framed with the view to attain that end. The Loans are made at a fixed interest of 10 per cent although the current rate is much higher. The land mortgaged (exclusive of collateral security) must not be of less value than double the amount of the loan. The non-payment of interest on the day it becomes due subjects the mortgager to 2 1/2 per cent additional interest for the period in arrear; and all parties in default for ten days are to be proceeded against the Solicitor of the Company without further instructions and without distinction or exception of any person whatever. The Colonial Board only draws on the Company as loans are agreed on; their bills must be advertised for public competition and the purchasers pay the amount in exchange for the Bill to the Bank of Australasia (the Capital of which is t120000) to the credit of the Company to be drawn out by checks of the Colonial Board in favour of the borrowers as the mortgages are completed. The high character of the members of the Colonial Board affords the fullest assurance that these arrangements will be strictly adhered to in spirit as well as in form; no difficulty has been experienced in investing the full monthly amount sanctioned by the instructions of the Court of Directors: indeed the Chairman of the Colonial Board states that he does not entertain the smallest doubt of a safe investment of all the funds which may be placed at the disposal of the Colonial Board. The high rate of interest in Australia has attracted much private capital from this country to be invested in mortgages. These investments have been made through the agency of individuals or mercantile firms and therefore subject to contingencies from which the Company is exempt. To those who may desire to make such investments it must be obvois that the stock of the Company presents a much superior security and the prospect of a greatly increased return inasmuch as the Company derives a large profit by lending at 10 per cent in Australia the money borrowed here at half that rate. It is equally clear that those who merely seek temporary employment for their money without becoming shareholders cannot have a better security than the Promissory Notes of the Company for the due payment of which the whole capital of the Company as well as the mortgages on which the money is laid out stand pledged. Every shareholder is required to execute in a Deed of Covenant by which he becomes bound to pay to the full amount of his shares and the Charter supplies Creditors with the utmost facility in enforcing demands against the Company. When it is considered that the funds of the Company here are kept in Government Securities and no money lent in Australia except on the best mortgages on land with collateral security in addition it may be fairly asserted that in many respects the Promissory Notes are entitled to a decided preference over mortgages in this country which generally bear one per cent. less interest than that paid by the Company. The Charter provides that the sums borrowed shall not exceed four times the amount of capital paid up. That the whole capital of the Company and all the mortgages on which their money is lent in Australia shall constitute a security to the lenders of money to the Company. That the mortgages are to be on land with the power of taking collateral security on stock &c. That every mortgage shall be registered–the register to contain such particulars as the Governor of the colony may deem necessary. That a copy of the register of the mortgages shall be kept at the office of the Company in London for the information of the share-holders and lenders. That an annual report be made to the Lords of the Treasury of all sums borrowed by the Company and of the appropriation of them. John Innes Managing Director. No. 48 Moorgate Street. London 1st January 1842
