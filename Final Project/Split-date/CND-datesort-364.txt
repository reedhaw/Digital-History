It is startling to think that 1800 persons quit the kingom every week never to return. The natural increase of the people must be about 1100 per day of whom emigration carries off 250 leaving 850 to swell the Census. The emigration to our North American colonies was as follows:– To Canada 21209 –New Brunswick 8056 – Newfoundland 387 –Nova Scotia 972 –Cape Breton 437 Prince Edward's Island 1214 Hudson's Bay 18 32293 To Australia it was:– Swan River 224 South Australia 2748 Port Philip 3473 Sydney 7 Van Diemen's Land 299 14392 ,emigration;census
