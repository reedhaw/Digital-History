   ID245,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1834,11,11,inform,Colonel C. J. Napier has been appointed Governor of the embryo colony in South Australia and we believe that a fitter appointment could not have been made. We only regret that Colonel Napier has not been sent to superintend a colony founded on something like sane principles. But if this Australian project end as we have little doubt it will do in the ruin of those who are weak and silly enough to embark in it no one will ascribe any part of the failure to the incapacity or unfitness of the Governor. The whole blame will fall on the contrivers of the scheme. ,colonial government
